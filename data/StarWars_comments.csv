Like, with Boba Fett, at least there’s an understanding that he’s just meant to serve as antagonist and foil to Han Solo in the OT.

Grievous was introduced in 2003’s Clone Wars as an immensely imposing villain. I watched this very recently, and holy goddamn does it hammer in how badly Lucas handled his movie debut. Why does Grievous in “live action” feel more like a cartoon character than his portrayal in an ACTUAL CARTOON?

Like many other things, there was an attempt to rehabilitate his movie portrayal in the newer Clone Wars series, and as much as I love that show, I don’t think they succeeded in his case. He appeared a lot in the early, not-that-great seasons, and he hardly shows up at all in the later seasons when the show hit its stride. Bottom line, Grievous never got back the mojo he was introduced with. Disappointing.

Now Phasma… one could argue what I said about Boba Fett also applies to her. But what really frustrates me is that her potential has already been realized on screen. The Last Jedi has a deleted scene that actually follows up on her decision to “help” Finn in The Force Awakens. 

When Finn brings up how she deactivated the shield on Starkiller Base in front of her stormtooper unit, before her underlings can even process this, she fucking murders them all. On top of this just being cold-blooded, it actually adds an incredible amount of depth to her. In one broad stroke, it communicates a lot about her character, a nuance of cowardice mixed with brutal survivalism, climbing the ladder of power by force. It also makes her the perfect foil to Finn, who ran away from the First Order despite the risks, and became loyal to a better cause.

This scene was perfect. It was 10x more badass than anything Boba Fett did in the OT, and it enriched the narrative… AND THEY FUCKING DELETED IT.

As someone who generally loves this movie, this remains my BIGGEST gripe with it. Just… WHY? Why did Rian Johnson write and film a stroke-of-genius character moment and then cut it? The only theory that kinda makes sense to me is some Disney exec made him delete it because it was too violent or something.

And to rub salt in the wound, they essentially repurposed this scene and gave it to Hux in The Rise of Skywalker, except his scene isn’t nearly as cool as Phasma’s. Sure, him betraying the First Order makes sense because he’s a petty weasel who loathes Kylo Ren, but his version of the scene is just kind of goofy. 

Then they did this scene AGAIN with Crosshair in The Bad Batch. Seriously. There are two scene in canon that are inspired by a *deleted* scene, but most people will never know this.

I hope they make a “Book of Phasma” or something one day.

Imagine someone asked you to get started building a house, so you put in some foundations. Nothing fancy, just some solid foundations that always work, they’re familiar, they absolutely 100% can support a house.

Then you hand the job site over to the next guy, who decides that every single thing people expect from a house, he’s gonna do the opposite. A frame? Haha yep, a frame made from delicious red vines. Walls? Lol sure, walls that go SIDEWAYS. Insulation and wiring and plumbing? It’s all there but it’s not connected to anything and it all just kinda terminates in a big glass box that’s got 12 hamsters in it. Everyone working on the house is utterly baffled at the choices but nobody says anything.

Eventually, people get to see his work so far. Everyone fucking hates this house now except for 3 people who blindly love everything that contractor does, and one guy who thinks not liking it means you hate red vines.

So they bring in the first guy to try and finish building the house, except there’s nothing to build on TOP of. He’s just gotta make the best house he can out of this mess. The result it as shitty as you’d expect, and then the final insult: everyone blames the LAST guy for fucking it all up.

Rian Johnson is sort of a hack. He has a committed army of dick riders, and he can put together a movie that feels complete, but they’re always *off*. They always feel like someone let a redditor write a script for a movie based on a thread he made when he was high, and he can’t believe nobody’s handing him any edits or notes on it. And the ultimate coup is that at the end of all that, he has a primed group of people who all say “lol it’s meant to be that way, you don’t get it.”

The game released in 2005 on the XBOX. A co-op campaign would’ve made a ton of sense even if it was a few small levels. Especially given the game is so damn short. Now sure you could argue that the single character sections are the reason. But I counter, for a game that is about working in a squad you shouldn’t be running around alone. It defeats the entire point and is a legitimate critique of the title. 

Honestly if there was a required dedicated solo section, use Sev and treat it as an unwinnable firefight. Really hammer home how important it is to work in a team and have your backs. Separating for the guns had to happen but it costs the team Sev. Otherwise there isn’t really any consequences to running solo or not using squad commands.

Instead they spend one episode of him being all sad and mopey, then going on a dumb Leia adventure traveling all over the goddamn place and repeating scenes we've seen before from Fallen Order and Star Wars Rebels. 

Could have been a small contained, well written story on Tatooine. Focus on Obi-Wan's depression, trauma and loss of connection with the force due to his shame. He keeps Luke protected once or twice by killing thieves or sandpeople that raid Owen's farm, but it's hard for him and brutal. 

Sure, have inquistors in it, that's fine, but Disney literally has to tell US EVERYTHING ABOUT THEM like us fans are fucking dumbasses. Reva plot was so dumb. Just have a random Inquistor (no explanation/backstory) come to tatooine and kill a hiding Jedi. They  then find or get word that a man named Ben Kenobi lives there and they investigate. Obi-Wan fights and barely kills the inquisitor and Vader gets wind of Kenobi being there. 

After the climatic fight with Vader which is not copied from Star Wars rebels and leaves both of them barely alive and breathing, Obi-Wan tells Vader this is the last time he will see him, that he is traveling to beyond the outer rim planets. 

Vader believes him, is thrown off the track of Obi-Wan and leaves tatooine with no knowledge of his own son hiding there. 

2 hour movie. No Leia, Reva or other necessary ridiculously stupid plots.

But the main character arcs of Maul, Ahsoka, Ezra, Kanan, Hera, Kanan are so incredibly well done. The heavy themes through and dark episodes are emotional and well written/developed. It gives so much more depth to Anakins overall tragic story and fall to the dark-side. 

A lot of live action series are going to have details expanding on these animation shows and have characters from them. Also they have absolutely some of he best star wars moments in ANY and ALL media. Like up there with the OT moments.

Boba may have died like a bitch in ROTJ, but he ended ESB as the guy who talked back to Vader and kidnapped Han Solo.

I figured Ben was actually pretty weak in the force. The weight of the Skywalker Legacy helped drive him to a dark place that Snoke could exploit due to his insecurities, and he latches onto Vader as a role model as someone Ben figures climbed up and seized their own power. Also could have set up a more unique dynamic between the villain and hero, always the villain is portrayed as this insurmountable, Uber powerful being that the hero has to struggle and dig deep to find the power to overcome. Except Star Wars always plays that trope straight until the last second. Hell, it did play it straight with Vader in RotJ, then subverts it with Palpatine. Then subverts it by having the hero join the villain in the PT. Would have been interesting to turn it on its head from the start, by having the villain be the one forced to deal with a stronger foe through trickery and tactics. Then you could combine the PT and OT tropes to have Rey try and fail to overpower Snoke, and have Ben turn and beat him with brains, not brawn. Honestly, the same scene from TLJ, but with Rey giving an actual bit of a struggle instead of just getting completely shut down, would have made a good climax to the trilogy imo, after investing in the characters some more.

Hell, I didn't even hate the Palpatine concept too much. The execution was just horrific. If we had had the hints from Mandalorian and more clues earlier in the trilogy, it could have worked imo. Obviously, they didn't plan it from the start so they couldn't do that, but if it had been set up I think it could have been good. Then just dispose of Snoke some other way, while hanging a big question mark on it at the moment it happens, raspy laughter as he dies.

This isn't official, mind you, but as a head-cannon this has always worked for me.

Tibanna gas is highly volatile, therefore dangerous to mine, store, and transport prior to refinement. The gas (or liquid, depending on your source) would need to be protected, but more importantly rendered temporarily inert for hyperspace transportation.

The devices used in the carbon-freezing process not only protect, but place the gas in to a low-functioning stasis, reducing the molecular motion in order to lower the risk of incident while in the container.

The same devices, if modified properly, would be able to place a living subject in the storage container in to a medical stasis. Not too different from a hypersleep pod as seen in dozens of other SF franchises (think Ridley Scott's Alien and it's sequels). Now, there's only some slight retconnoning they needed to do when they did the same thing in The Clone Wars episodes as it seemed like Lando wasn't sure it would work, I just now assume it was because the BESPIN devices had never been used that way, but carbonite in general was known to be an effective stasis chamber.

Like I said, not an official explanation, but if you just use your imagination to fill in the gaps that's how you make Star Wars ""your own"" ...... at least until someone overwrites your ideas in an actual episode later on. :) 

Now.....

The question really is, why did Vader need to use the carbonite to transport Luke to Palpatine. Seems like they could have just captured him with the use of the full garrison of troopers. Using the carbon chamber to trap and flash-freeze him really depended on things going perfect for Vader (they didn't .... he had one shot at it).

We see Dooku have an apprentice with Ventress. I'm sure this was common with Sith Apprentices. I'm not sure what is canon or not, but I think it's a safe bet that Maul *was* a proper Dark Lord once Plagueis was out of the picture. 

Lucas made a big deal out of parasitic relationships with the Sith, both in relation to the Master / Apprentice bond and the Sith's power coming from leaching from the Force itself. So Palpatine would look for (or create) the most advantageous Apprentice for himself rather than take whomever was around. 

Maul was a weapon. We've heard Dooku, Palpatine, and Maul all comment on their opponents' anger and how that gives them *focus.* Maul was like sentient anger that was laser focused wherever Palpatine pointed him. 

He sped up Palpatine's plan by doing much more dirt than Palpatine could have while maintaining his cover story. He was the most advantageous Apprentice until he suddenly wasn't. 

If Maul had killed Anakin when he went for Qui-gon on Tatooine, and had he successfully killed Qui-gon and Obi-Wan, the Sith secret would have been preserved, and Palpatine's original plan would have continued until he needed to bring in a Jedi, at which point he probably would have orchestrated a scenario for the hypothetical Jedi to kill Maul. 

I think Palpatine was always going to need a Jedi before he destroyed the Jedi Order. I have a theory on what the next step if his plan was after he established the Empire and had Death Stars. 

Remember, in the ST his plan was to have either Rey or Kylo as his Apprentice *and* as Emperor. He was looking to achieve something *bigger* than the Emperor. He didn't seem to care which one of them did it, which makes sense since they were a dyad. One *was* as good as the other to him. 

I don't Maul would have fit that role had Palpatine been able to progress that far. Filoni and Lucas grew him into a thoughtful character, but I don't think he did that great when he had Mandalore under his thumb.

If anything, having made The Clone Wars and weaving a tale so intricately between two movies that were much closer together, I’ve learned that there’s expansive room in this galaxy for us to tell stories and have characters doing things.

As a kid, when Yoda said, “When gone am I, the last of the Jedi will you be,” to Luke, I took that very literally. Well, now we know that’s anything but true. There are many different people that could wield the force, and maybe Luke is the last Jedi as far as what Yoda would consider a Jedi. So we’ll just have to wait and see how the story evolves and what makes sense. But in my experience, there’s definitely a way to weave everything together and make it exciting.

Firstly, you still haven't directly addressed anything I've said. You just continue to stamp your feet and scream ""you're wrong"". I would have been interested to see an actual argument about how the ST isn't just a rehash, or how it adds meaningfully to the larger Star Wars universe. So far, no one across probably a dozen replies from a few different people seems to be able to do that. 

Secondly, I didn't say the quote was a contradiction, you're whole damn comment was. You've spent all this time saying I'm wrong, then you admit that one of the most crucial plot points in the entire ST, the resetting of the universe back to the rebels vs the empire, is indeed a rehash but they *had to do it* because, ""star wars is at its best when it's an underdog against a stronger opponent"" (paraphrasing). Which is so hilariously silly I'm surprised you'd even say it. 

Not only does it undermine what little you've actually said to this point, it's wrong. Even if we accept the premise that Star Wars is best when telling an underdog story, you don't have to rehash the rebellion vs the empire to do it. 

The New Jedi Order series in the original EU is a perfect example. It introduces an entirely new group, the Yuuzhan Vong, which put the Republic and the Jedi on the back foot from practically the first book. They're powerful, entirely alien (literally coming from outside the galaxy), and they're force dead. They're used not only as an overwhelmingly powerful adversary to challenge the Republic and Jedi (making them an underdog in the conflict), but they actively expand Star Wars lore in interesting ways. They add new culture, new technology, a new perspective on the universe, and they force the Jedi to deal with a threat the nullifies their biggest advantage, the force. (BTW, see here how I said you're conclusion was wrong, explained why it's wrong, and then gave an example of how it could be done right. That's generally how you have a conversation)

Finally, my point about the quote was that it was ironic, given who Gaiman is and what his career was about. The context you posted only reinforces that. He isn't saying that you should just give you're fans what they want. He saying that it's the constant struggle of a creator. To innovate and do new things while simultaneously keeping people happy who just want more of the same. He literally says, in the quote you posted ""...I am doomed to give them strawberry ice cream for as long as I do this thing, and **I will hate myself**""

The ST is just more strawberry ice cream.",,,False,False,[],False,{},,,False,False,True,t3_11dma1x,,,True,/r/StarWars/comments/11dma1x/this_article_suggests_that_shows_like_the/jao2fov/,public,False,,[],1677789747,r/StarWars,0,,,,1677789766,1677789766,2c3a00827d55b3580e6d6164e4fd6da34212a510,2023-03-02 20:42:27,,

I'm slightly disappointed my theory isn't correct-- only because it was a fun way to view the scenario-- but not because I think it's necessarily better. I'm actually more motivated now to pick up the ROTS novelization because I've been meaning to for quite some time now. Apparently, it holds the answers I seek.

But yeah, the reaction from the community was awesome. I think today's strong emphasis on associating being wrong with \*""losing""\* has made people become insanely unreasonable and close minded, about a lot of things. I wanted to ensure that although I was confident in my theory, that I left room for myself to be mistaken because I know I haven't consumed every piece of Star Wars at this time, so there was bound to be things I was unaware of. I'm sure that had my comment been written like I was \*correcting\* someone with a tone of authority on the matter, I might've provoked some adversarial challenges.

Regardless, this is the best part of Star Wars to me. Discussing and theorizing to fill out the untouched or incompletely explained parts of the universe.

Your point about Maul brings me to something that I've always wondered about. What was Sideous' ultimate plan for Maul? Because Sideous took Maul as an illegitimate apprentice under the Rule of Two-- while he was still apprenticed to Darth Plagueis-- Maul was never a legitimate Darth. I'd argue as well that Maul was trained much more like a Sith assassin, seeming to focus mostly on becoming a skilled and powerful combatant. Sideous really lacked interest in combat, having already mastered all 7 lightsaber forms and preferring not to use lightsabers at all. He was much more interested in Sith sorcery and unlocking the secrets of the force. So, I'm wondering what his ultimate plan for Maul was. Would he keep him on the side as a secret assassin/apprentice? Or would he dispose of him in some way? It was clear that he already had plans for Dooku, and as you said-- the emergence of the Chosen One meant to Sideous that he could have the ultimate Sith apprentice that would end up taking his place. I also wonder if Sideous realized (or when he realized) that Anakin was the result of his master's work.",,1-4 bigFlair,False,False,[],False,{},,,False,False,True,t3_11fv4fv,,dark,True,/r/StarWars/comments/11fv4fv/just_now_realizing_that_dooku_warned_kenobi/janz43e/,public,False,Sith,[],1677788492,r/StarWars,0,,,,1677788512,1677788512,1d5a3b93b32cd83cd465ce7f67b5a7862d18eac3,2023-03-02 20:21:32,,

- Han Solo does fuck all in Return and should’ve died in Empire as intended.
- Boba Fett looking badass but doing nothing was a meme for 40 years and then they gave him their own show and he still did nothing.
- Mace Windu is boring as heeeell and he’s played by this actor famous for his intensity.
- Padmé has barely any agency of her own and just plays hopeless teen in love with the emo kid.
- Qui-Gon has to be the most circlejerked character ever. He’s not this rogue grey Jedi. That’s something the fans made up. He’s b o r i n g.
- Darth Maul might as well have been a test dummy for the amount of characterisation he got. He’s literally ‘devil man’.
- Count Dooku is just moustache twirling evil count instead of a supposed political idealist.
- Finn was a cool idea for a character but he ended up going nowhere.
- Poe is a different character in all three of his movies.
- General Hux is a cool idea for a character, fantastically acted and there’s hints to more. But he ends up having barely any bearing on the story.
- That weird bounty hunter looking girlfriend of Poe shows up at the end like we’re supposed to care.
- Phasma has zero characterisation but she’s treated like this personal arc villain for Finn like lol?

This isn’t about sides. It’s about truth.

I have little doubt that there’s corruption in some of the organizations they’ve “investigated.” But that doesn’t make what they’re doing actual journalism. And if you want to talk about corrupt, take a look at where Project Veritas gets the majority of their funding.

Being able to speculate based solely on what was on the screen at the time and not getting hung up on future knowledge of the series is getting to be a lost art in some circles. Good job there.  

I don't doubt that Sidious kept his true identity a secret from Dooku when he first approached him. It's reasonable to speculate that investigating Qui-gon's death and the reappearance of the Sith led Dooku down a path that would eventually end with Sidious. 

By the time we actually see Dooku on screen, he knows. With all the rhymes and echoes in the Saga I think it's safe to assume that Sidious kept him in the dark until he was so bought into ending the Jedi Order and reshuffling the Old Republic that he couldn't stop participate in the plan. 

That would be the same strategy that he used on Anakin. Palpatine didn't tell Anakin the truth until he knew that Palpatine was the *only* person who could prevent his nightmares from becoming reality. 

(Not to muddy the waters, but *TROS* told us that Palpatine had the ability to put voices in people's heads, so Anakin's nightmares were probably Palpatine's doing.)

I don't doubt that Dooku had a similar reaction to Sidious' truth as Anakin did in Palestine's office. Drawn saber, flowing hate, all of that, but stopping short of killing him. Maybe they even fought. Who knows. 

Point being that it was an established pattern that we can kind of, sort of also see with the Emperor and Luke. Get the prospective student to the point where they can't say no. 

I think that pattern is a more likely scenario than Dooku never figuring it out. Once Dooku started dipping his toes in the Dark Side a whole new suite of Force techniques opened up to him. I think it's unlikely that a Sith master could hide their double indentity from their Sith apprentice, especially when that apprentice had been a Jedi Master.  

All of Palpatine's apprentices are in awe of his *vision.* His ability to foresee things through the Force. Which Anakin, and presumably all other Jedi, were taught not to indulge in. I think Dooku was distracted by that. 

Palpatine has a grand plan but he also changes that plan on the fly. His plan would have worked had Maul lived and things progressed to seducing a powerful Jedi like Dooku. But he called an audible when The Chosen One popped up.

In TFA, he really hits hard with his Hitler-esque speech as they launch the starkiller base weapon for thr first time. That scene really hit me when I first saw it as his fury and intensity was so much like the Nazi rallies.

Then in Rise of Skywalker, he is supposed to be a spy? And his death is so underwhelming. It was great that he was killed by the new General but it just felt so flat.

The OG: Without a doubt pissing way Han, Luke, and Leia's lives into disrepair and humiliation is the biggest sin. Not giving is one scene with them together? Really? The entire usage of them was a giant middle finger to fans. This is the answer. You pissed away our childhood to replace them with crappy carbon copies. 

Finn: It was cool to have someone who was a Stormtrooper defect. You had the whole plot about them being taken as kids. It could have been an arc and instead . . . it went no where. There are random bits. ""Hey this random group of deserters is good and maybe one is Lando's daughter."" The idea he is force sensitive could also have been cool and tied into why he left, but it was just one random throw away line. The romance with Rose. Relegation to wacky humor in Episode 8. So many wasted opportunities. 

Rey: FFS make up your minds about who she was going to be. Honestly having her turn evil would have been the most interesting outcome. Instead we got perhaps the most boring protagonist in the entire series. I don't think Daisy is a great actress, but the writing for Rey was atrocious. 

Poe: He at least had some okay moments. Still wasted and his whole arc in Episode 8 was dumb.

That would mean recruiting new people. Will he force them all to follow ""the way""?

I feel like it would be narratively amazing for him to remain a Zealot.

But it doesn't seem very ""Disney main character"" for him to be that way. Even tho the rules of his 'religion/cult' aren't actually that extreme at all.

I think it's boring when characters have no flaws. Mando will become one of those characters once you take away his religious extremism.

He'd be literally a prince charming that can wil any battle, forge any friendship and at the same time he's caring and responsible and good looking and just the hole bunch.

I'd hate it for him to ""wake up"". It's the one thing that makes him unique in contrast to so many perfect protagonists.

If you’re going to twist my arm though, I would say…





Echo. We’ve followed his evolution and story arc for so long, and he is a total paladin: selfless, loyal, brave, devoted, dutiful but three dimensional enough to be a fully fleshed out person, not a cardboard cutout. He’s gruff and stoic, frequently grumpy and long-suffering, forthright and occasionally argumentative, yet gentle and caring and he learns to grapple his fears, open his mind and let go of his prejudices.

As a long time role player, I have a massive soft spot for characters who feel driven to do the right thing even, and especially, when it costs them personally. He’s cut from the same cloth as Rex, who he tries to live up to, as he sees his Captain as the ideal soldier and the man he should emulate.

In some ways, Echo has become even greater than Rex. Rex has endured so much. But just a fraction of the things Echo has suffered would absolutely destroy most people, clones included, yet he keeps doing his best to not only keep going, but to keep doing his duty AND to make the galaxy a better place. 

He’s incredibly resilient, but he’s not untouched by the things he’s suffered; he’s just learnt to compartmentalise his feelings and press onward. 

We see a few hints of this throughout, but most notably when he talks to Omega a bit about his time as a prisoner of war, why he joined the Batch, and how he went where he was needed. (Though I think in S7 of TCW he needed the Batch a lot more than they needed him.) Then most recently how surprised and touched he is when she embraces him during their goodbye and he hugs her back.

Like many important questions in life, this one isn't a straight yes or no.  It's a yes with an if and a no with a but at the same time.  Lemmy splain.  No, there is too much, lemmy sum up...

First, you really don't want to be asking questions like this.  If you go too far down that particular rabbit hole, your fluffy white tail may never be the same.  Before you know it, you'll start asking questions about other characters from fiction, questions that you don't want to know the answers to.  For example, Superman is always clean shaven, but what kind of razor can shave the man of steel?  Better yet, how much horsepower does the General Lee have under the hood, or what modifications have been done that allow it to squeal its tires on a dirt road?  

You know those old guys you walk past at the mall, always sitting on a bench staring at something only they can see, mumbling incoherently?  Those guys used to be normal like us, but they asked too many questions about stuff like that.  Don't become one of those guys.  But since you DID ask, I'll answer that question for you.  Lemmy re-read your question again... okay, got it.

Procreation didn't happen A Long Time Ago the same way it's done these days, and the laws of science were very very different in A Galaxy Far Far Away.  Today, we know all about sexual intercourse and reproduction, mostly thanks to the invention of MTV.  But A Long Time Ago, roughly when your parents were teens, sex just wasn't a real thing.  Babies were delivered to their parents by a magical stork at night, carefully wrapped and placed in a basket on the front porch.  Or, if the expecting parents lived in an apartment unit, babies were left on the balcony or fire escape.  That's why the term ""delivery"" is still used by medical science to this day.  I'm sure people had sex in those ancient times, but a) that's not how babies were made and b) they definitely didn't enjoy it very much.  Sex for fun didn't actually exist until somewhere around 1984.

Then there's that other factor, which is the laws of science in A Galaxy Far Far Away.  This is a galaxy where gravity exists in outer space, sound travels in outer space, underwear doesn't exist (George's rule, ask the Force-ghost of Carrie Fischer), laser light moves slower than a bullet, the largest military force ever assembled never taught any of their soldiers how to aim before firing, a race of cute Care Bears can defeat that same military using the exact technology that never worked for Wile E Coyote, and where there is no such thing as trying. 

How can you expect the laws of science as we know them to apply in such a place and time?  Even the Force can't explain that stuff.  As my wise mentor once said, you must unlearn what you have learned.  Luminous beings are we, not this crude matter.  No more training do you require, already know you that which you need.  Finished is your training, diploma I sent you, or perhaps en route to the post office lost it I did.  What the hell want you from a man who is years old nine hundred, English perfect?

Species age differently.

One thing that bothers me about Grogu is that since he is a baby, he has never been able to contribute all that much, except for the cuteness factor, haha silly baby don't eat that jokes and the occasional time when he saves the day with his force powers, of course, he also has an impact on Din's character, but he himself is not really much of a character. I would like it far more if Grogu was someone who has opinions and can talk, so he can engage with Din in a more meaningful way. 

Why they picked the N-1 for him is baffling to me, at cool as it is, I just don't understand why Din would ever accept it, he originally protested when he was first offered it BoBf and to this day I don't get what made him change his mind.  


The whole IG-11 thing is pretty funny, huh xD Again I hope they put some effort into explaining why Din wants him IG-11 so badly and why he still trusts him after he immediately went back to trying to kill Grogu. Also as you have already said, it is really weird how the bomb that sat literally in his chest and is specifically designed to destroy him completely, so that no information can be retrieved from him just doesn't do its job at all.

Personally where i’m getting worried is the fanservice. The N1 is terrible ship for Din as he needs a ship that’s designed for travel; a ship where he can sleep, store several days of supplies, store weapons and ammo, etc. its obvious the ship was chosen because its nostalgic and comes with a child seat… 

then there’s grogu. Din and Grogu were great together and We spent a whole season building up to their separation and it made for a fantastic climax to the 2nd season…. And then they reunited a few episodes later in a spin off series; they didn’t even bother to recap it. It kind of undermines the previous climax to reunite them like that; they might as well have not separated them at all. IF they were to be reunited then it should have the same kind of build up and care as their separation. The whole thing felt rushed just to get Baby Yoda back in the show. And i’m already wondering WHY grogu is here. Grogu worked before because the plot revolved around him, but now he’s feeling really pointless. I’m actually worried that he’ll start feeling like a burden

Most ships and technologies in the Skywalker Era would fit in alongside the ships and technologies from the KOTOR era some 4000 years prior.

Compounding this is the spoken and wheel design of Galactic politics. Most of the power and large populations are located in the core worlds, whe spoke, and the rim worlds are somewhat subservient to them. Many worlds originated as colonies of some kind or another, and they don't always gain real equal independence. Further the wealth of individuals and corporations in the core worlds can easily legally buy the entirety of certain worlds.

Finally its a matter of sheer numbers. If the Republic has a trillion sentient people in it then a million people is just a millionth if the total population. A million people can die and it would not even be a matter of galactic interest. So there's lots of people to fall through the cracks. The Jedi themselves only number several 10s of thousands which is why they are so easy to vanish after the Jedi Purge, they were a legend to most people anyway.
