If you read Vigilanted then you wouldn't know that AFO tried to steal Erasure. That detail is only revealed in the main series.

&gt;As for killing All Might we've been told and shown that wasn't his goal. Winning or losing didn't matter much to him at the time because he'd already gotten Shigaraki out and he could still get a result he wanted. In fact, a lot of the series has happened exactly because of his choices. 

If AFO doesn't want to kill All Might and his ultimate plan is for somebody else to steal OFA then he shouldn't be allowing Tomura to go off on missions specifically to kill All Might. If Snipe was just a few seconds later at USJ then All Might and Izuku die and OFA ceases to exist.

&gt;They explained the regeneration thing already as 'he didn't find the quirk in time and its more important to power-up his next body' 

Even if it won't heal his old wounds it's still objectively better to have it then to not have it. It would still automatically heal any future injuries he sustained. Theres no excuse not to give it to himself when he has the doctor copying it over and over and over and over and over ... you get the point.

&gt;and I don't think there's been a point in the series where it was confirmed he knew what Overhaul could do.

When Overhaul meets with the League of Villains Tomura recognizes who he is and says it's because AFO once showed him a photo of Chisaki.

When he breaks out of Tartaros AFO immediately recognizes Chisaki.

It's also implied by the decorations on the walls in Chisaki's flashback that he was raised by AFO and Dr. Garaki (which is such an unnecessary plot element but everything is ""more crap about how All For One had everything planned out from the start"" these days)",,,False,False,[],False,{},,,False,False,True,t3_11g4c3d,,,False,/r/BokuNoHeroAcademia/comments/11g4c3d/is_all_for_one_actually_smart/japgi03/,public,False,,[],1677811060,r/BokuNoHeroAcademia,0,,,,1677811079,1677811080,52518ac88d4e3a0ef6bfe0849bddb3ba43b10f8a,2023-03-03 02:37:40,,,

The manga/sub line implied that Deku just saw a person in danger and wanted to save them whereas the dub line seems to imply (to me at least) that Deku only chose to save him because it was Bakugo. Like the emphasis on the ""you"" in the dub line makes it feel like Deku only took action and saved Bakugo because it was someone he knew and if it was a complete stranger, he could have just stood there with the rest of the civilians and watched that stranger die. But in the sub/manga, it felt like as long as someone looked to Deku like they needed to be saved, he will save them. It felt like a more ""heroic"" and ""selfless"" type of line compared to the dub and those are pretty big qualities in Deku. And that motivation to save anyone that needs it follows him with Eri and later Tenko/Shigaraki (that exact quote is called back in the war arc when Shigaraki escapes). 

Plus a lot of the motifs in the manga/show are about saving people (body and soul), not just not letting them die. Bakugo and Deku even have that parallel messaging of Win to save and save to win and, imo, having that ""important-ish"" line not be in the beginning episodes of the dub feels like it's missing an important message of the series.

Also they do address that because we're constantly shown or told why Shouto struggles with certain aspects of not only his fire at times but also things like his drive and other stuff.

This is where we seem to misunderstand each other because you think I was talking about Shouto moving on from the abuse or that I said he's been entirely successful in moving on. No all I said was that was what his arc is about, moving forward and healing but moving forward is not just moving forward from the abuse but moving forward from his own dark and spiraling feelings he had in the beginning and confronting his own actions which is why we had the whole Inasa confrontation because Inasa was someone he hurt when he was so full of rage he couldn't see anything but his own hatred for Endeavour. But here's the thing Shouto's story is not done and it's not a linear one there are still things he needs to confront one of them is his victimhood and true feelings when it comes to Endeavour. 

Am I a bit worried this might not happen? A bit yeah because truthfully besides from Shouto and Dabi everyone else seems to be putting Endeavour into this weird light and that includes the narration itself. If I'm being honest here Endeavour's redemption or rather atonement arc has kind of felt very flat ever since the first war arc ended. 

Shouto is a victim and of course there is nothing bad about that and in fact I have said many times before that Shouto and Endeavour's arc can't conclude until both of them confront this to finally bring this part of their story full circle. Endeavour can't finish his character arc until he not only confronts how he treated Dabi but how he treated Shouto as well. Shouto is the only one who he still hasn't apologized to and still hasn't accepted he did anything wrong there. in fact he believes he gave Shouto everything. Shouto also needs to confront his own true feelings regarding Endeavour because Shouto is angry about his past treatment he see it when Endeavour called him son for the first time in his life and he gets very angry. I will admit I will be going into guesswork here because Shouto can either be a very easy character to understand or a very hard one and trying to get into his head space when it comes to Endeavour and the abuse he suffered because he hardly gives anything away there and we only get scraps like Shouto getting angry at being called masterpiece, Shouto getting angry when Endeavour called him son for the first time. I also believe he projects onto Rei a bit because he says that he struggles with forgiving Endeavour because of Rei but I don't think this is true. He doesn't struggle because of Rei he struggles because of himself. 

And you're right when you say Shouto can't truly move forward until he confronts this about himself and confronts Endeavour. Same as Endeavour he can't truly gain atonement until he acknowledges everyone he hurt in the family and not just the ones who is glaringly obvious. Otherwise Shouto will never truly be free to be himself and Endeavour will never truly atone.

I'm not Endeavour fan and I have never once said Endeavour's own arc was a brilliant masterpiece that is flawless in it's writing. In fact I'm not a fan of Endeavour at all and believe his redemption arc while started off on a good note that looked promising fell flat very quickly. This is mostly because he has yet to make any real steps in atoning for this family. The most he has done is buy a house. I also don't like it when people think him doing the bare minimum and equal saving people and being a better hero means Endeavour has atoned when it comes to his family. No, no and no again.

Uraraka compliments Bakugo's cutting skills and in the sub/manga, he just responds with ""How can someone be bad with a knife"" while in the dub, he just yells at and insults the skills of his classmates (""how can you ppl be so damn bad at everything""). It's just needlessly aggressive for no reason. 

I'd also say the anime portrays Bakugo as more aggressive and undermines his growth when compared to the manga. For example, Bakugo and Deku both punch each other in the final exam arc in both the manga and anime but in the manga, both punches are drawn with equal force (so it doesn't look like one of them is more violent towards the other), whereas the anime makes Bakugo's punch look super violent while Deku's is just a light tap. (Additionally, Deku is just shown to be way more scared of him in the anime than he is in the manga, which just makes Bakugo look worse in comparison) 

The anime also takes away a lot of Bakugo's introspective scenes (like him thinking back to Todoroki telling Deku about his abusive past after Todoroki told him that they shouldn't be violent towards kids in that provisional license kids part) or they add scenes that don't make sense with his growth (like s6 Bakugo complaining about being tasked with helping the evacuees when in the manga, he was not bothered by having to save ppl).

Honestly, while the anime is great at fight scenes and giving background/Side characters room to develop, it isn't the best at showing the growth of characters like Bakugo. .And I'm just not the greatest fan of the dub either.

I've seen this take a lot and I don't really get it. Just because none of them are prominent in the story doesn't mean that their badly written or not dynamic characters. Plus it isn't like bnha as a story gives a ton of focus to its extended male cast, the only characters in 1A that get more focus than Uraraka are Bakugou (who is the main rival) and Todoroki; the latter of whom I would argue doesn't actually feature in the story more than Uraraka, but is just related to one of the two best written characters in the story, thus making Todoroki more relevant than a lot of other characters by default

Touya didn't have *that* bad of a childhood

I'm not going to argue Endeavor was a good father to him, because that wouldn't be true, but he wasn't an abusive father at that point either. The manga makes this distinction much more clear than the anime does and shows how Touya's death was truly the catalyst for Endeavor becoming the monster that he was in the rest of his children's childhoods. Which is frankly something I find more interesting 

Izuku's dream to be a quirkless hero was indeed unrealistic 

If Izuku had wanted to be a rescue hero I think that would be a different story, since another set of hands helping to treat the wounded and move rubble would always be appreciated (though arguably he would be a normal paramedic at that point) to be a support or combative hero would be impossible. Support heroics necessitate having a quirk which can help combative and rescue heroes from a distance, such as Erasure and Telepath or Search, meanwhile not having a strong quirk in combative heroics can make you a liability.

They were the steps Naruto had to figuratively ascend to reach his goal. And yet slow-burn progression was never made.

In MHA’s case, Deku would have to progress through each of the school years. There’s no ranking, but yearly sports festivals would’ve made great showcases of his progress, probably culminating in a #1 win during his third year.

Anyways, I agree that these systems aren’t well-tapped into, and I blame it on the Shonen Jump publisher/editor’s culture.

A huge theme in this series is stepping aside and letting the new generation take the lead. That’s what All Might did when he gave Deku OFA and said, “it’s your turn,” after defeating AFO for the second time. 

He passed the torch. It is Deku and his generation’s time. He is the one who will defeat All For One, save Tomura, and lead the world into a new age of heroism. 

Yoichi and his successors chose Deku to carry their power. All Might chose him to be the next symbol. Deku has already shown himself to be able to do what even All Might couldn’t : inspire villains and fallen heroes to change and believe in heroism. 

All Might’s methods as well intentioned as they were, and as successful as they were inspiring heroes did not change the underlying problems of hero society. His time is over. 

Plus, and I can’t stress this enough, ALL MIGHT WOULD NEVER ACCEPT OFA FROM MIDORIYA. He entrusted it’s power to Deku for a reason. And he believes in his student. Nor would the vestiges abandon Deku to die. 

Plus, this is a battle Shonen anime. The MC always succeeds in the end. There’s this weird minority of the MHA fandom who seem to fundamentally muss that.

She's a kid trying to understand the world that makes no sense to her. She and her issues were pushed into a box to be normal until the box could no longer contain her. She was called a monster by her own parents, and rather than be helped she was shipped off to a conversion therapy style counseling. 


&amp;nbsp;



None of the villains have particularly been proud of their kill counts so I don't know where that perception comes from. Himiko and the League have found a place to belong after being discarded and pushed away from their lives by the people around them, or the mistakes they made. They see a world that was not made for them, and seeing a hero kill someone for an impossible scenario is confusing and anger inducing. She's hurt and she wants Ochaco and Izuku to heal her pain, but they don't know how to yet, and honestly I think Ochaco will figure it out.


But I don't think this means Himiko is pure evil, she's in pain and Izuku didn't understand her point. She wanted to be understood as a person and not just a monster. Izuku tells her he would never be like her, and honestly he doesn't know what she's going through, it's not his fault he misunderstood her.

What you gonna do when you already said all that there is to say? That's right, quote yourself: 

&gt;This fandom's attempts to turn any interpretation of the story that goes against the popular vote of ""The Todoroki family plot is genius and Endeavor is one of the best anime characters of all times"" into ""You don't get the story"" is incredibly tiresome and condescending. MHA is not fucking Hamlet and as much as I hate to brag here, I think my four uni degrees have actually empowered me to at the very least grasp the general themes of a manga that is written for 12-year-olds to be able to comprehend. So no, I do not struggle with understanding the plot, I dislike parts of the plot, just like many other people do. And they get to do this. Even if it is your favorite story of all times, ever.  
Also in case anyone on here aims at a respectful discussion with people, implying that they are just too god damn stupid to understand your fave manag because you dislike their opinion is a horrible start.

We have a whole thing about it in JTA which lead to Shouto finally accepting that he still has a long way to go when it comes to his fire. Even in the recent arc he's still developing his fire power now alongside his ice.

Saying ""I still have a long way to go to master this power"" is not an arc. And neither is not having perfect control over his power without addressing WHY he struggles with his fire powers and then working on fixing that WHY during the arc. Which I am pretty sure you are aware by now is what I ask for when I talk about an arc. 

&gt;What are you talking about? Shouto has been moving forward way before Endeavour stopped being abusive or rather started thinking about atonement. This has been a thing since the Sports Festival. It's not something he just decided to do because Endeavour had a change of heart and mind. This is seriously twisting Shouto's story arc to the extreme.

I never said Shoto started to move forward **from his past** only after Endeavor's....whatever that mess is. I pointed out that my issue with Shoto is that his abusive past gets glossed over, to which you replied that his story centers around ""moving forward"", to which I replied that it is impossible to move forward without addressing your past and those who hurt you. Which is why Shoto considering moving forward from what Endeavor did to him **in a way that considers forgiveness** the moment Endeavor is not proactively abusive for the shortest amount of time is bad writing. And him moving forward to **being his own person, separated from his father** did in no way need or benefit from that plot. Endeavor's arc did. So again, those things are two different concepts. You can decide ""I am my own person now and my abuser does not influence my future anymore"" without deciding ""I might forgive them"". And in Shoto's case ""being my own person"" has been utterly consumed by ""Endeavor earning Shoto's forgiveness"" (with barely any insights on how Shoto feels about this, apart from....considering forgiveness after two weeks). 

&gt;I will say you are right about one thing that one can't heal fully without confronting the past somewhat and now thinking on it Shouto has been confronted by the past on a couple of occasions like in the JTA and with Inasa. 

Which was, again, directly linked to Endeavor. The root cause of his conflict with Inasa is his supposed similarity to his dad. And those two getting past that directly translates into Inasa also deciding to work on his very reasonable dislike for Endeavor for....reasons. Up until referring to Endeavor as a ""light of hope"" in recent chapters, despite knowing that he is a decade-long wife and child beater. 

And honestly, I do not understand how, after that very quote being recent canon, it is a controversial opinion that the Inasa/Shoto plot served Endeavor. 

&gt;And I also think Shouto's idea to not paint himself a victim will be something that will be addressed when he makes it to where Endeavour and Dabi are.

Shoto is a victim though and there is nothing bad about this. Countless amazing, strong, successful people are, not because they paint themselves that way, but because others made them victims. And I do not see it as genius development for a character to reject that label (it's actually pretty cliched), even less so if it gets then used as a gotcha moment in his confrontation with his evil brother who ""paints himself as a victim""...because he is. It is fine to tell Touya that his abuse is not an excuse to hurt others, and it was actually one of the recent Shoto moments I quite liked. Telling him ""Don't play the victim"" on the other hand, would be both a lousy message and, again, in direct service of taking Endeavor's responsibility for how he turned out away. But who knows, maybe this does not happen at all, and I will be positively surprised. 

&gt;No he doesn't exist to make Endeavour look redeemable like I don't get where you have gotten an idea like that from. Shouto's own feelings of guilt doesn't take away Endeavour's and the story nor Shouto has ever said otherwise. In fact Shouto has told us over and over again that Endeavour was the reason Rei had her breakdown and told us that Shouto blamed Endeavour both for his scar, what happened to Rei and the issues in the house itself. Like I don't know what story you are reading that makes you think Shouto exists solely to make Endeavour look redeemable.

Again, at no point have I said that Shoto did not empathize Endeavor's responsibility for what happened to Rei (not himself though which is another issue I have) **at the start of the story.** Overcoming his family's past and his own trauma was originally a major part of his story. Then the author decided to redeem Endeavor and Shoto was turned into one of the plot devices in that arc. And honestly, the entire ""You just don't get the story like I do"" because people do not like my opinion gets old at some point. 

Endeavor is a fan-favorite, to a point of people thinking he is a much more important character than his son, because he gets treated that way. And the majority of people root for Shoto to forgive Endeavor more than they root for him to do anything else at this point, which is telling. 

&gt;No Natsuo and Dabi aren't the only ones confronting Endeavour in fact Rei and Fuyumi also confronted Endeavour in the hospital.

Fuyumi blames herself for being too scared to do anything, and Rei is slightly more confronting than the rest at first, until she also attempts to take blame away from Endeavor as well. And I am sorry, but if you now want to tell me that Fuyumi and Rei had good arcs, I have to assume that this is just about getting a reaction out of me. 

&gt;Shouto did not comfort Endeavour in the hospital at all but was willing to hold out a hand and work with Endeavour because he knew personal feelings aside they needed to stop Dabi together. Let me remind you what happened some chapters later when Shouto told Endeavour that he didn't care how his words made Endeavour feel because he wanted to see Endeavour take action not feel sorry or have fuzzy feelings.

You know what? If Endeavor not taking action, which is now canon, will bring him any sort of negative consequences that come from Shoto once this entire war is over, I will actually come here, take back everything I just said, and admit that Shoto had a character arc independently from his father. Because in that case, yes, he only put his personal feelings aside to help people, not for the implication of those two growing closer. I doubt this will happen, but we shall see. 

&gt;Deku made that assumption and even if it's true so what? There isn't a timeline on when or how someone should forgive another person. The fact that Shouto is still considering it even now why much shows that this isn't an easy decision for him but even if it was that doesn't matter.

Ignoring the fact that irl I would rec therapy to any domestic abuse victim that forgave their abuser after a couple of weeks of not outright beating or verbally insulting them, we talk about fiction here. And ""Alright I forgive you"" after a view weeks of no outright bad behavior would matter, because it is bad writing (aka my original point). 

And to be clear, no I do not say this is what happened. What I do say (repeatedly) is that forgiveness was a consideration ridiculously fast (and with the terrible implication that kind people forgive their abusers) and that Shoto's way there is utterly underdeveloped. 

Which I will also take back to in case he does not actually end up forgiving Endeavor, working with him, honoring him in death or sitting around the dinner table joking with him. 

And believe it or not, I would actually love to take it back. 

Last but not least, let me make one point of my own: This fandom's attempts to turn any interpretation of the story that goes against the popular vote of ""The Todoroki family plot is genius and Endeavor is one of the best anime characters of all times"" into ""You don't get the story"" is incredibly tiresome and condescending. MHA is not fucking Hamlet and as much as I hate to brag here, I think my four uni degrees have actually empowered me to at the very least grasp the general themes of a manga that is written for 12-year-olds to be able to comprehend. So no, I do not struggle with understanding the plot, I dislike parts of the plot, just like many other people do. And they get to do this. Even if it is your favorite story of all times, ever.

We have a whole thing about it in JTA which lead to Shouto finally accepting that he still has a long way to go when it comes to his fire. Even in the recent arc he's still developing his fire power now alongside his ice. 

What are you talking about? Shouto has been moving forward way before Endeavour stopped being abusive or rather started thinking about atonement. This has been a thing since the Sports Festival. It's not something he just decided to do because Endeavour had a change of heart and mind. This is seriously twisting Shouto's story arc to the extreme. 

I will say you are right about one thing that one can't heal fully without confronting the past somewhat and now thinking on it Shouto has been confronted by the past on a couple of occasions like in the JTA and with Inasa. But both of those was about himself and not about Endeavour. And I also think Shouto's idea to not paint himself a victim will be something that will be addressed when he makes it to where Endeavour and Dabi are. 

No he doesn't exist to make Endeavour look redeemable like I don't get where you have gotten an idea like that from. Shouto's own feelings of guilt doesn't take away Endeavour's and the story nor Shouto has ever said otherwise. In fact Shouto has told us over and over again that Endeavour was the reason Rei had her breakdown and told us that Shouto blamed Endeavour both for his scar, what happened to Rei and the issues in the house itself. Like I don't know what story you are reading that makes you think Shouto exists solely to make Endeavour look redeemable.

No Natsuo and Dabi aren't the only ones confronting Endeavour in fact Rei and Fuyumi also confronted Endeavour in the hospital.

Shouto did not comfort Endeavour in the hospital at all but was willing to hold out a hand and work with Endeavour because he knew personal feelings aside they needed to stop Dabi together. Let me remind you what happened some chapters later when Shouto told Endeavour that he didn't care how his words made Endeavour feel because he wanted to see Endeavour take action not feel sorry or have fuzzy feelings. 

Deku made that assumption and even if it's true so what? There isn't a timeline on when or how someone should forgive another person.

But I'll bite, and play devils advocate(I don't have/support any particular theory for ending of BNA).(deku just needed to have super strength for the parody/reference)

Deku losing his quirks wouldn't be a bad writing choice at all. It's something long speculated even early on, that OFA might be given up to stop AFO for good.


Which now that quirk vestiges, AFO intent for OFA and quirk singularity, and the repeated emphasis on All Might/OFA carrying everything on the shoulders being a mistake(the Era of OFA should end), Deku losing OFA has a multitude of reasons to happen.

Certainly OFA dies with Deku. As it has been made abundantly clear it will literally rip the next person apart(another point supporting it being used to end AFO.)


Meanwhile Deku giving up his power to stop AFO for good, and to heroically save others, IS one of the most heroic things he could do period, short of dying. His narrator montage of ""the story how I became the greatest hero"", doesn't have to be about literally becoming the most powerful hero of all time, a superman.

Furthermore as part of the process, or post quirkloss, deku as a now quirkless individual could prove that anybody can be a hero to others, they don't need busted powers to be a hero.


It could even lean into Deku going back to how people thought the story would go originally, with Deku becoming a hero using gadgets and his analytical abilities to become a hero.

And if we go really far back, in the original one-shot Izuku was a quirkless adult.




The point here, is simply that deku losing his powers wouldn't be a bad writing choice itself, it absolutely can be substantiated by what has come before. It's not a bad writing choice, just a choice you subjectively don't like.

That doesn't mean people wanting it to happen are any different/better than your opinion either. (Wanting something to happen and finding/forcing evidence to support it, is entirely different from making a conclusion based on Canon and where you think it may/could go)

And if you are a victim of decade long abuse, moving forward and healing happens by confronting the past. Those two concepts are not and can not be mutually exclusive, which every therapist (or person that had to actually recover from abuse) will confirm. Which is exactly what happens in Shoto's arc though. He gets ready to move forward the moment Endeavor stops being outright abusive for a couple of weeks. The fandom eating this up has nothing to do with good let alone realistic writing and everything with the fact that the majority of the people still left here are desperate to pretend that Endeavor ""isn't that bad"". 

I also wonder why, if ""his story is not about confronting his past"", he would need to confront Rei? Which he did not btw. He still thinks that he somehow failed her and the entire plot is feeding into the narrative that it is on the 14-year-old abused kid to ""save"" his mom and dad. Shoto explicitly exist at this point to make his father look redeemable. He is a plot device that serves Endeavor, and this fandom's blind Endeavor admiration is the reason why you get such strong reactions to pointing this truth out. Meanwhile when you claim that Rei ""made Endeavor beat her"" it's crickets and upvotes. 

Furthermore, the fact that people use terminology that is explicitly associated with victims recovering from abuse, such as ""confronting the past"" reveals another issue of the writing. Endeavor gets treated like someone that is recovering from trauma by the narrative. Not like someone that has inflicted trauma upon others. He is the thing that needs to be confronted by his family. Which the narrative can not acknowledge though because it would not serve the Endeavor wank fest. 

Aditionally, Natsuo and Touya have been the ones to consistently call Endeavor out. Shoto started out on that path too, but that has long been replaced by him literally comforting his dad while he cries....*over abusing him and his siblings.* We even get an entire scene where Endeavor is all grateful for Shoto's emotional support (while still completely ghosting his request to face Touya together). 

And I never claimed that Shoto verbally forgave Endeavor. I claimed him considering forgiveness after a couple of weeks of no outright physical or verbal abuse is unrealistic and bad writing that only serves Endeavor. Who up until this point has done nothing to make amends to his family, apart from no longer outright abusing them, crying, sending Rei flowers and thinking about maybe buying them a house.

Agreed.

 The problem isn't that Erasure would have been an incredibly useful quirk if AFO had stolen it. The problem is that AFO knows about Erasure and wants to steal it and yet for no reason at all he only ever made a single attempt to get his hands on it.

If Horikoshi had simply not had doctor Garaki say that the random villain attack that killed Shirakumo was actually an attempt by AFO to get Erasure then everything would be alright.

&gt;And how can you not see that not giving himself regeneration is dumb it’s one of the best quirks in the series and he has easy access to it because fr Garaki has copy’s of it and all the nomu have it.

Yeah there really is no good explanation for that one. He gets his hands on Super Regeneration and the has the doctor copy it over and over and over and over and over ... again and gives it to most of the Nomu and Shigaraki. Even if it wouldn't heal AFO's old wounds it would still heal any wounds AFO received in the future. Its just better the have it then to not have it.

&gt;And if he had erasure he could have just given it to shigaraki so the hero’s couldn’t use it and whoever shigarki fights couldn’t fight back

A good example of this would be Search; a quirk AFO says he's had his eyes on for a while. This quirk requires eyes to gain information on new people and yet despite having no eyes and thus being unable to use the quirk (and potentially not knowing the information was stored and would be avail to a new user) he still stole the quirk and gave it to Shigaraki. 

Just do the same thing with Erasure. Steal it and give it to Tomura and/or some Nomu

&gt;And before you say “there would be no plot” you should consider that horokoshi shouldn’t have written it that way it was a horrible writing choice the he should have never made and should have did something differently.

For MHA, it deviated from its premise of a young lad learning to be a hero in a hero school. You would expect the series to follow Midoriya’s progression as budding hero across all three years of school. But instead, the very introduction of the League of Villains was always a bit of a problem, as giving the students their opposition so early into their safe school life leads to the potential for straying them away from said school, with it did. For a series with the words “hero academia” in its title, it sure doesn’t spend enough time there physically and narratively. 

The school was always a stepping stone for something else, like license exams and safe houses before a battle. It needed to be more important, but that’s not the story we got.

In Naruto’s case, it introduced the mission rank system and ninja ranks. Narrative-wise, you would expect the series to follow Naruto as progressed through the ranks, with each rank being a milestone in his journey all the way until he became Hokage. He’d take on higher rank missions as his own rank got higher, showcasing his improvement and reliability.

The Todoroki Family Electirc Boogaloo is getting stale, old and tiring. They’re other characters worth caring about in the series. 

I can’t believe Mirko got mutilated TWICE! How?! Why!? 

Bakugo should’ve apologized to Izuku for how awful he treated him after he was kidnapped from the League of Villains or at the very least after their fight in UA. What a crappy “friend”.

Why did Ryuko have so much trouble fighting Shiragaki?

Where is Bubble Girl in this current story arc? 

Stain should’ve had a bigger role in the series.

Spinner should’ve worked for Stain. Not Shiragaki.

If Dabi wants to keep his “daddy issues” that’s on him. But he should ditch Shiragaki and make his own organization instead of riding the coattails of another one’s.

Toga’s characterization is so awful it makes my head spin. It’s worse then her design. The yandere trope doesn’t suit her tbh. Especially how skilled at close combat she is. 

Izuku struggled yet succeeded in mastering one of One for All quirks in the earlier story arcs but the last 2-3 story arcs when it’s revelation that he has multiplied quirks, he masters them at a short amount of time? Seriously?

And speaking of mastering quirks, how come barely anyone at his Quirk got “stronger” with their quirks during training? Power-scaling in this series is so awful. Especially since Mr. Twinkle Twinkle belly laser still gets a stomach ache.

Speaking of which, it’s so idiotic that Aoyama is the traitor yet Izuku forgives him just like that. He might as well not have been the UA traitor. Especially when he came clean as to why he and his folks did what they did. 

You sakuga animators making fan animations on Twitter really need to do some Mirko fan animations. Enough of those Endeavor fan animations(and you know who you are) and nothing against people who like Endeavor making fan animations of him. But why isn’t anyone doing any of Mirko? Huh?

Put Quirkless Deku up against Muscular, Overhaul, hell Current Shigaraki and AFO he is going to die and people need to except that.

Vigilante characters should not show up in the main story. I see people wanting the characters to show up in MHA, and tbh I don't want the reason Vigilantes works because 1. It's actually a GOOD prequel, 2.it has its own story that doesn't tie into the sequel, or I should say it doesn't rely on the sequel as much, 3. It works by itself, 4. It's a good read, and 5.

Star and Stripes was handled ok at least imo. While I guess I would've liked at least a mention prior to her being introduced, she worked as a plot device she served her purpose as to getting killed

People need to stop expecting OP levels of worldbuilding when it comes to MHA. I could care less about the US. This is a Japanese story, so of course America would not be as important as people want it to be. I would rather see more of Japan see what makes all the islands or at least some of them different.

 -Overhaul: humiliated only to give Shigaraki the perma delete quirk bullets, which are totally wasted by him. Ironically given the reason to Chisaki when he said that Shigaraki only waste resources, when the point of their ""rivalry"" was to probe the exact opposite.

 -Re-Destro: oh boy, the existence of this guy is straight down sad. He basically was created for the solo excuse of give Shigaraki an army (which is wasted anyway) when his presentation and concept was one of the most interesting in the entire series for a villian faction.


 That being said, I have another unpopular opinion: Nine from H.R could have fill the spot of main villain infinitely better than Shigaraki. 

 Just think about it.

 Nine is a quirk supremacist and Overhaul believes quirks are the plague of humanity. They could have an amazing idealogical confrontation, and an actually interesting rivalry for the control of the underground after the defeat of AFO.

 If Re-Destro and the MLA meet Nine it would be basically their dream materialized in a single person.

1. Guns aren't used as often in MHA because they are straight useless. Anyone who keeps up with 5% Deku (Which is basically every student and pro-hero) fodderizes gun users.

And he is the victim of Endeavor's abuse (some might argue the one that suffered the most, though I would disagree that there's a ranking there). The fact that this is almost exclusively glossed over, to a point where Deku tells us Shoto considers forgiving his father for 14 years of solid child-abuse after doing slightly better for a couple of weeks is *terrible witting.* 

I do not like the forgiveness narrative in general, because I know where it ends irl, but if this is where the author so desperately wants to go with Shoto, fine. Then it should be explored through out his story, and considering forgiveness should stand at the end of it, not at the start. 

Instead Shoto's main role in this last arc is being the emotional support squishy for his abusive dad. And before that his character had barely anything going on since ""accepting his fire"". We received no real exploration of him re-connecting with his siblings (and the view scenes we got were a set up for Endeavor''s ""UwU I don't want forgiveness, just atonement"" speech""), and we had barely any exploration on his feelings regarding Rei and his feelings regarding Touya, that are actually interesting, considering their mirror roles, get swept under the carpet in favor of more man pain for Endeavor. 

So yes, Shoto has been sidelined for his dad. If you like that angle, fine, I really don't care, enjoy.

And Eri could still use and train Rewind with lizards which she does. 

AFO doesn't magically win in the hideout arc with erasure or regeneration for example. 

\&gt;Afo being a narcissist doesn’t mean he has to consistently make stupid decisions like not giving himself regeneration even though all the nomus have it. 

How would regeneration help him? It doesn't fix his injuries, and All Might beat him by knocking him unconscious. Regeneration heals fresh injuries, it doesn't make you immune from being knocked out. Moreover, AFO intentionally never acts directly in the first part of the series until he has to so he had no need for regeneration then.

assuming he knew how to do so with that quirk, unlike Monoma, AFO's quirk doesn't give him understanding of powers automatically. 

and that still doesn't solve AFO's base problem of his body being unable to handle newer quirks well. Plus, the whole point of Tomura was to become a new body that through Tomura's hate would allow him to get OFA. AFO views his original body as expendable by the final war arc. He doesn't care what happens to it. So if he has two ultimate options to fix his body if it comes to it he's taking the easier one. Becausee apart from not caring at that point about his OG form, AFO is lazy and only ever does the bare minimum. He's not spending time learning Chisaki's quirk if he doesn't gain immense benefit from using it. 

Which brings me to my problem with your post. You're ignoring that AFO isn't us. he's not an outsider looking in on an event. he's a character written to have certain flaws. He's arrogant, impulsive, cruel, and most importantly devoid of doubt. In all of his appearances, no matter when AFO always demonstrates his belief that he is right. That every action he takes is correct. He has never once felt or shown self-doubt. So his first thought on an action will be the one he takes. That is why he's doomed and why he always loses. Whether with Yoichi, in his attempts to seal oFA, his losses against All Might, and now the final War. AFO never accepts he made an error. He always takes the path that appeals to his belief in his being the invincible demon king. But that doesn't make him completely stupid. AFO makes a ton of dumb choices (especially as of late), but he also excels at manipulation, planning long term, and is very observant.

I really don't get this point. AFO had no eyes so erasure was useless to him for years. Not to mention it's not actually that OP (the second you blink it stops and you have to look directly at people). It's extremely useful, but  and AFO and Shiggy don't even benefit from it much because of how much they outclass everyone but OFA users. When you can match All Might and Deku respectively, you're not gonna feel a need for erasure. Especially when you're AFO, who believes himself invincible and loves using his quirks to dominate others. Plus we don't know if erasure would or wouldn't cancel out their own quirks. 

\&gt;And he would have won back in kamino if he just killed allmight and left the area instead of going on a monologue about how he is going to win. 

Lol okay, but you get that AFO is a narcissist, right? This is something that gets me about these kinds of criticisms. AFO is a flawed person. he's a sociopath consistently presented as having almost no impulse control when it comes to messing with people. He lives for inspiring hate, boasting, and de-moralizing people. You're right he could have won, but that wouldn't be who he is. He'd never take that action because AFO's need to feel superior and hurt heroes, especially all Might at that point, means he'll make those mistakes. Also, being smart doesn't mean always being rational. 

\&gt;Then he could have just waited for shigarakis surgery to be done or did it one himself and it would be no need for the war

That's what he did in prison anyway. He waited. Also no he couldn't. All For One's body post-OG All Might fight is severely damaged and not even hyper-reenergation fixed it. The whole point of taking Shiggy as a vessel was to mitigate this problem. His health problems meant the surgery was much more likely to kill him than Tomura.

I actually don't think this was a problem for Bakugo regarding Kirishima.

Someone like that thinking Bakugo needs help makes Bakugo worry about how weak he himself is then.

By contrast, Kirishima not only had a decent Quirk but was constantly trying to keep pace with Bakugo and treated him like an equal. Bakugo wouldn't have been okay losing to him, of course, but unlike Midoriya he could be seen as a worthy opponent. Kind of a ""winning against him proves my strength"" instead of ""struggling at all against him proves I'm weak"".

Only reason Todoroki's great power triggers Bakugo so much was because he refused to use his fire against him when they fought after he did use it against Midoriya. It sent the unintentional message of ""You are not worth it"", while Kirishima came at him at full force.

Heck, if Bakugo really did look at Kirishima like you're saying I don't think he would have taken his hand to escape Kamino Ward. It would have been just like when Midoriya tried to help him when they were kids; someone who should be weaker than Bakugo looking down on him and thinking he's weak.

He respects Kirishima's determination to not break or fall and this respect was further enhanced when they fought each other.  Even though Bakugou won, we see some inner monologue from Bakugou during the fight showing he was impressed with Kirishima's strength and the fact the he could tank his blast without being pushed back.

I've seen people criticize him for going after Midoriya personally when Aoyama lured him away, but since then we've seen that AFO had the ability to warp his allies to him from their hideout if he needed them, had Spinner go to free Kurogiri so that they'd have his warp Quirk back on their side, and had a copy of Eri's Rewind within himself.

As far as what he has done in the series, his plan to take over Shigaraki probably would have worked had Hawks not gotten so much intel. Even then, it was a close call between just how strong Shigaraki became and how close AFO came to taking him over.  


I think his current struggle against the heroes is thematically fitting. One of the themes that has been building since the fall of All Might is ""no one can do it alone"". Even All Might ultimately failed to create a lasting peace on his own, despite his great efforts. Society is saved, at least partially, because there are other heroes that could rise to the challenge, showing that together, they could surpass All Might.  


Contrast that to AFO in the current arc. The villains still have a significant advantage with Shigaraki alone, but AFO is starting to lose in his own goals. Unlike All Might, he has no one to fall back on. Even Toga's reinforcements are more for her own goals and Shigaraki than they are for AFO. In the end, AFO is ultimately alone. He couldn't beat All Might, so now this group of heroes that together surpass All Might have a chance of victory.

The author seems to have started off with the will to have a main character (Deku) and two secondary-main-characters (Shoto and Bakugo). But then somewhere along the journey he was like ""Meh, bored now"", and from then on both of them lost most of their plot-relevance. Which is why the Touya-Shoto thing is now mostly ""Endeavor feels bad about being a lousy dad for 20 years UwU"" and Bakugo.......has probably started to decompose by now. 

It just feels even more obvious with Bakugo because 1).....dead for months and 2) he never really had his own plot outside of no longer being a bully tbh (in opposite to Shoto who is at least still involved in the Todoroki family drama plot)

What they should have done for Bakugo is to set up a rivalry with a villain that mirrors his flaws and then follow that one through in the same way they did with other main characters. Had that been the case I doubt anyone would give too much of a fuck that he is weaker than Deku.

She is not using twice’s quirk exactly.

It does not matter as much now but they still matter. The heroes are not able to contain all the twice/toga clones. And let’s not underestimate Uraraka. She is most like higher than an average pro so she can take on a twice clone however she is still struggling because of the sheer number. 

Because as we see, not every hero is going to get caught in the initial blast radius. Also, the was not a blast of energy but air which is not the same. And doing so does not prevent AFO from getting attacked from a distance. And we see that in this chapter, him fighting against the heroes is wasting his time because he has rewound even further. 

There is a difference between success and what happened. While Kirishima is onto of GM, he is heavily injured so we don’t know how he succeeded. And even if we did not know the success, it would ruin the setup of seeing him com to the battle which was supposed to be a surprise. And we don’t know all the details which is not an issue. 

Also, it is never stated that he cannot make people do complex things but can’t make them use their own brain which later on, he can do. He literal commands. During JT, he literally have the vine women use her quirk to subdue her classmates.

It seems that you don't remember the war arc at all besides the final few chapters lol. 

1. Kankuro, Sai, and Omoi get focus as they take down two Edo Alatsuki members

2. Milfune and Darui get focus as they take down Hanzo and the gold/silver Brothers respectively

3. Ino, Shikamaru, and Choji work together to defeat their former sensei and have multiple chapters/, episides of focus

4. KB has multiple moments where he was mvp against the Edo Jinchuriki and Ten Tails

5. The entire Shinobi alliance worked together and managed to temporarily trap the 10 tails

6. The combined efforts of the entire Shinobi alliance were needed to pull the Tailed Beasts from Obito

7. Karin, Suigetsu, Orochimaru and Jugo contributed against the enhanced spiral zetsu that has Hashirama jutsu

8. Kabuto saved Sasuke’s life

9. Itachi was the primary combatant in the fight against SM Kabuto and succeeded in releasing the Edo Tensei 

10.  As you already know, Guy and the Kage had multiple highlight moments and focus.  You can’t just discount their contributions to suppprt your arguement 

&gt;Obito didn’t do anything in the fight against Kaguya lol he found Sasuk

This right here is proof that you didn't read the fight.  Obimto literally saved both Naruto and Sasuke's life from Kaguya's disintegration bombs. Also Even if Kakashi getting a DMS powerup was an asspull, you can't argue that his contributions weren't vital.  

&gt;He hasn’t surpassed All Might yet, that’s only when using Fa Jin to get to 100%, that’s why they called it Faux 100

He's capable of going 120% which is above Prime All Might.  Shiggy is explicitly stated to have physicals relative to Prime All Might and Deku punched a jole through him in seconds 


&gt;Naruto and Sasuke took Obito, Madara and Kaguya on alone. They won each battle as well

Except they didn't 

1. Obito: the combined efforts of the entire army were needed to pull the chakra out of Obito.  This was explicitly shown 
2. Madara: they never defeated him. They failed to stop Infinite Tsukyomi but then Madara got betrayed by Zetsu

There was not a single villain in the war arc in which Naruto and Sasuke took down completely by themselves.

Complaining that the main characters were the ones to take down the final villain is nonsensical when many side characters had already been given highlight moments throughout the war arc.

With Midnight it might be one of two things, and this is indicative of the whole manga:

1. It was badly written and badly executed, with no intention of sexism.

2. And this is what I think he was going for is the idea that in war your are not necessarily killed by a hero or a worthy boss. Even a stray bullet could get you. That is a very deep thing to talk about, especially in shonen. 

Either way i don't think that it can be attributed to sexism. 
Lets not forget that asian societies are not sexist in the way the West understands them today. 

For example, in pre republican china, female widows had such a power over the inheritance that they could do whatever they wanted without the consent of the male heir. A principle that cannot be found in pre war european societies.

The manga makes it pretty clear Toga feels connected to Ochaco in a way she doesn't feel toward many others - just like Deku and Twice.  

2. Tbf we never really see full blown mastered use of cloned quirks in the manga.  All possibility it would be like a mirrored version - just like the clones themselves.  Imperfect and prone to being fucked up.  But the problem is Twice could make tons and tons and tons of the same quirk.  Even if they were pretty easily vanquishable by a pro hero.  

3. Ochaco always had weaknesses to her quirk - from vomitting to having to hold her breath and such.  She's been progressing with her quirk over time.  Toga's is basically the abstraction of chosen blood bonds given physical form.  

4. She's compatible with Double, but not necessarily those she's doubling, would be my analysis.  

5. Oh yeah this one's easy I've been thinking about this a lot.  I think it represents Ochaco's flightiness and inability to remain grounded on a single goal.  She's a bit lost.  While Deku is idealistic, Ochaco's trying to find her way.  It was never about money, it was just the reason she gave for pursuing hero work because she always cared about her parents deep down all along, and before then couldn't stand the prospect of pursuing her dream for her own reasons alone.  Basically untethered without others around to keep her tethered. Which parallels Toga's constant tethering to others.  

6. Deku literally talks to himself.  AFO is currently taking Ls from everyone around him including his quirks more or less.  Shigaraki became the obsession of decaying the things that hurt him and hurt those he cares about.  Instead of using decay to save, like Deku/Bakugo save to win and win to save.  As for Monoma: we never see what's going on in his head directly aside from him feeling like an impostor of a hero.  He also cannot use quirks that stockpile because he needs to be able to copy it long enough to stockpile power.  

7. Messing with someone's psyche as wells a body can cause so much internal pressure that they inevitably snap or kill themselves in depression.  For the nomu it seems their psyches snapped.  

8. I'm referring to the fact that stated imperfections in the quirk system have been referred to from the start, and the possibility that other imperfections exist already that we don't know about.  For Monoma it is quite likely that he is not borrowing a quirk, but literally mirroring it in the same way that Twice does, but to a much greater affect.",,sticker0-1,False,False,"[{'a': ':deku5:', 'e': 'emoji', 'u': 'https://emoji.redditmedia.com/fzf4ntshjxj21_t5_34a0h/deku5'}, {'e': 'text', 't': ' '}]",False,{},,,False,False,True,t3_11ew6xk,,dark,False,/r/BokuNoHeroAcademia/comments/11ew6xk/chapter_382_prerelease_thread/jalg256/,public,False,:deku5: ,[],1677740960,r/BokuNoHeroAcademia,0,transparent,,,1677740974,1677740975,35f4e7a7044313dc54a32c1ea30ac097a36e5f8a,2023-03-02 07:09:20,,,

1. If this whole resistance thing exists, then why was Ochako’s Quirk working perfectly when Toga used it with her Transform? They don’t exactly strike me as people who think the same, and I certainly don’t see them being on more of the same wavelength as Toga and Twice. 

2. Why would the psychology/Quirk thing make it so that Double’s “Cloning people clones their Quirk as well” rule is forced to function under Transform’s rule of “I can only use the Quirks of people I love?” It didn’t to that for Zero Gravity. Why is the hole suddenly a different shape from *this* peg?

3. And following that… yeah, how come Zero Gravity’s ruling wasn’t changed to something like “I can only make people float properly if I love them,” or something along those lines? 

4. And following *that,* wouldn’t that make Toga more compatible with Double, since she’s lonely as well? She chases love from people she knows don’t love her, and she feels alienated from everyone because she likes drinking blood. Why would Double not work perfectly for her? The holes are shaped more similarly than Transform and Zero Gravity.

5. What psychological aspect of Ochako would you say Zero Gravity represents? And why would that resonate so much with Toga that she could use the Quirk with relative ease? I would assume it has something to do with lifting people up, but Toga doesn’t seem to particularly want that. She wants to be free to do whatever she wants, so if Zero Gravity were altered to those specifications, it should be changed to “I can make myself and any of my equipment float,” right?

6. Why was the whole psychology/Quirk thing never much of an issue for Deku, AFO, Shigaraki, and Monoma? I mean, there *were* some issues and complications, but…

- With Deku, you could point to that *one* time where Balckwhip went haywire, assuming you don’t chalk it up solely to a lack of control over the enhanced power of the unexpected new Quirk. I mean, there is also how he couldn’t use 100% without breaking his arms, unlike All Might, but while there are some psychological blocks there, a lot of it came down to a lack of the skill required to handle the force 100% creates. All Might was just a natural.

- AFO had that Vestige Rebellion thing, but it only happened to him once in, what, a century? And that was just because Jiro got the ghosts pissed at AFO, and not because of any lack of compatibility or resistance. The Quirks worked perfectly fine before that. 

- Shigaraki had that New Order thing, but S&amp;S had to *make* New Order do that. Nothing inherent about that malfunction.

- Monoma has never had an issue using a Quirk that he copied. At most, he has gotten Quirks he couldn’t use because the Quirk, at its baseline, was worthless because it needed time to gather energy. He could always use the Quirk he copied exactly as the original user could use it.

7. I thought Nomus were mentally messed up because altering someone’s genetics to extract and mess with their Quirks was, expectedly, something that could seriously mess someone up on a biological level. Messing with DNA directly would probably kind of do that. I never really saw it as multiple conflicting psychologies making people unable to think.

8. Why would Twice’s clones being fragile and prone to melting lead to Toga’s clones not being able to use their Quirks at all? Twice’s clones weren’t perfect, but they *could* use their Quirks. Hell, whenever he made a clone that wasn’t of himself, the clone could use the Quirk just as well as their counterpart could. And that didn’t come from an awakening. Even when Twice’s clones made less-durable, and thus less perfect clones, those clones were still capable of using their Quirk to make clones. And presumably, the clones of LOV members made by clones could use their Quirks.",,,False,False,[],False,{},,,False,False,True,t3_11ew6xk,,,False,/r/BokuNoHeroAcademia/comments/11ew6xk/chapter_382_prerelease_thread/jaleel8/,public,False,,[],1677739742,r/BokuNoHeroAcademia,0,,,,1677739755,1677739755,0a9063bd8752c13a1c0028879c5ab2ee9f1c00e2,2023-03-02 06:49:02,,,

You can’t just have a clause that says “Sometimes, the established rules just aren’t followed because of unfathomable circumstances.” That’d be like if gravity selectively decided that it went sideways for no reason other than “Because gravity felt like it.” Not to say that everything in MHA has to follow the laws of physics, of course. But if you add conditions under which the laws of physics can be altered, you should stick with those conditions instead of changing them whenever not doing so would be inconvenient. If a writer makes up a set of rules and can’t come up with a reasonable or consistent explanation for why an exception exists, then it usually means that they’ve written themself into an corner. Illogical things happening because of “unfathomable” reasons are generally, subjectively-speaking, examples of bad writing. That being said, I don’t think unfathomability is what Horikoshi was necessarily going for.

This is massive cap.  Part 1 of Naruto handled characters incredibly.  

&gt;That’s not a shot but I got tired of seeing Naruto , Sasuke (sakura shoehorned) getting all of the attention and screen time. 

The entire first part of the war arc barely had any of them and was strictly focused on side characters like Sai, Kankuro, Gaara, Kakashi, Milfune, Darui, Shikamaru, Ino, Choji, etc.   There was also a period of time in which Naruto and Sasuke were both incapacitated and side characters had to work together to keep the main villain busy just like what side characters are doing in MHA right now.  Also there's a fight in the war arc where the combined strength of everyone in the army was needed to achieve victory.  

&gt;Hori is genius honestly

That's an overstatement. Practically every war arc in media has contributions from multiple people.  That's a pretty low standard if you consider something like this genius level.  

&gt;1 or 2 people dont win a war by themselves. I

Are you implying that Naruto and Sasuke 'won a war' by themselves?  The war in Naruto was only won due to the contributions of Itachi, Kakashi, Hinata, Ino, Shikamaru, Bee, Kurama, Guy, Minato, Tobirama, Hiruzen, Gaara, etc. Without every single one of those characters Naruto and/or Sasuke would have died in the war arc and the villains would be victorious.

We have less absolute drudgery like the several inconsequential chapters of Shiggy vs everyone, but I think we're going too fast now. Since every chapter has to end with ""THE moment"", all the returns and events start to feel oversaturated, cluttered and, as a result, less significant. Characters show up to do one big thing and then fade into the background so that the next character gets to do their thing instead of staying as consistent contributors. As an example, Tokoyami gets a hype chapter and then is repelled instantly next chapter, doesn't really accomplish much of narrative weight but look cool in the moment and then is replaced in the eyes of the reader by the next big thing (Gigantomachia), which will probably have to be explained in a chapter/s long flashback after this.

This happens to most characters present. Jiro did her thing and has just been wandering around earless for a while, with a speaking role in I think two chapters since. The non-Inasa Shiketsu squad have already lost speaking rights, and I don't think they've meaningfully contributed in the action after the Hawks save. Meanwhile, characters like the mushroom girl, shadow guy and Kamui Woods have been in the fight the whole time only to appear in action panels getting hit by an attack. If this is going in the ""everyone gets a moment"" direction, do these guys also have to do something cool later on, or is there an invisible barrier between a tier 4 and tier 3 side character that isn't really explicit?

Overall, I wouldn't say the writing quality is getting better, it's still falling into many of the same traps as before.

**Step 2:** Warp Kurogiri to himself using his own black goo warping quirk.

**Step 3:** Use Kurogiri to warp anywhere within 5km of Gigantomachia (or even farther based on hypothetical max range of goo warp quirk). If he cant wake up Kurogiri for some reason then just use Forcible Quirk Activation.

**Step 4:** Warp Gigantomachia to himself using the black goo warp quirk.

**Step 5:** Use Kurogiri to open a portal back to his cave hideout and return to base with both Kurogiri and Gigantomachia.

Midoriya has All Might tell his mom about One For All from the beginning, and things go from there. 

Due to UA furnishing the entrance exam recordings to the recommended students (so they can see who fheir classmates will be) Yaoyorozu takes an interest in Midoriya, which leads to friendship and romance. 

Some tidbits now.

All Might is a diabetic in this fic. Basically his pancreas joined his stomach and one lung in the injury list that AFO inflicted on him. 

Midoriya learns how to control OFA faster due to Yaoyorozu helping with his training. (She doesn’t know about OFA as of yet, knowing it by the cover name of Superpower) 

Inko is different than in canon, being more of a “mama bear” as opposed to the more passive version we see in canon. She can also keep up with Midoriya (or at the very least, understand his mumblestorms) when it comes to Quirk Analysis due to her research on Quirk Theory before Midoriya was diagnosed as Quirkless. 

Hisashi is dead. He was a security guard who worked at a Quirk research lab, and was killed in a villain attack. He died making sure that everyone else got to safety. This becomes a secondary motivation for Midoriya to become a Hero. 

Unlike in canon where we only know that Yaoyorozu is an heiress, I actually put a name to the company. The Sapato Corporation. One of the best support companies in terms of affordability and reliability, especially renowned for their line of civilian support items.

SO initially Deku caught up and sped past the bullet right before Chisaki got hit. Looking at that distance, Chisaki was around 4 buildings (diagonally) away from Lady Nagant. An average city block is about 100x200 meters, and the diameter (which looks to be 2 blocks) is about (guessing) 447.2 meters. (I did the Pythagorean theorem of 200\^2+400\^2=C\^2, with C being the distance)

A sniper bullet travels at BERSERK speed, with an average measure value of roughly 850 meters/second (aka \~1900mph). To put it into context, that bullet reached Chisaki in approximately 0.5 seconds. AND DEKU MOVED QUICKER THAN THAT.

&amp;#x200B;

Lemme try another case, this might be easier since we actually see the entire street and buildings in his Manchester Smash. We see the green energy lineup illuminate the area. I might be blind but I counted about 12 buildings, and they can vary in width. Let's just assume a uniform width of 200 meters each. So Deku is covering roughly 2400 meters with one Smash here. And if we use the time from that scene, it's about 1.76 seconds (I timed it with a stopwatch). SO METERS PER SECOND HERE: 1363.63 M/S, aka: **3050.36 Miles. Per. Hour.**

Lemillion has kindness as his intangible that completely crushed any flaw he had. 

Suneater I decided his intangible was “evolution” based off his quirk. He’s already versatile but he actually cause AFO concern with his big attack at a teenager.

Gale Force is my actual homer pick. I thought I would catch way more shit than this than putting Shoto at #6. But, this guy is recommended hero like Momo.

&gt;Missing direct shots against every relevant hero attacking him and failing to incapacitate them or escape them means he's been nerfed.   

No…. That’s not a direct shot against every pro hero, especially when every pro is all around the battelfield, you can literally saw that he didn’t hit everyone with the scale of the blow and hero’s are also trying to use some quirk for defense as well

&gt;Kamino All for One managing to instantly incapacitate several top heroes is a far, far better feat than your assumption that he killed no name fodders off screen. Are you seriously trying to argue that potentially killing featless fodders that we haven't even seen die is a remotely impressive feat or a valid arguement against his nerf?

Knocking out four pro hero’s that he caught off guard instead of fighting an entire army is now more impressive..?

&gt;He literally injured Prime All Might and brought him to the brink of death per All Mights admission.

Injuring him in a specific situation doesn’t mean that he was just as strong as him, endeavor could literally kill all might with his prominence burn, does that mean that the two are equals, we know that he only manage to hit him because he make him lower his guard by bringing up nana, not because he was just as strong as him 

&gt;And it took all the power All Might had left to defeat him not to mention it was a significant ly weakened version of All for One

So what…? A skeleton all might with the power of two punches isn’t better then an entire army of pro’s, he literrally beat him with an extremely simple tactic that afo didn’t expect because all might barely use any strategy 

&gt;No, it's not a dumb complaint because unlike most other villains who are monologuing, AFO was on an explicit time limit. In fact, Hawks even says that he was trying to get AFO to monologue to waste his time and AFO was so much of an idiot he fell right into that trap.  

He literally talked with him barely a minute and after that he was trying to escape all the time, the hero’s just doesn’t let him do that 

&gt;There are more panels of AFO monologuing then there are of him throwing attacks so yes he's been wasting a large portion of his time monologuing and is conintinuously failing to get away or permanently incapacitate the top heroes despite trying to multiple times.  

He just did two attacks and then get blocked by tokoyami right after… literally two attempts

&gt;I would have no problem with him gloating if he actually backed up his big talk but so far he's done nothing of the sort.

Missing direct shots against every relevant hero attacking him and failing to incapacitate them or escape them means he's been nerfed.   Kamino All for One managing to instantly incapacitate several top heroes is a far, far better feat than your assumption that he killed no name fodders off screen. Are you seriously trying to argue that potentially killing featless fodders that we haven't even seen die is a remotely impressive feat or a valid arguement against his nerf?  

&gt;1afo was never as strong as prime all might, he literrally start hiding after all might return and only managed to hurt all might by making him angry 

He literally injured Prime All Might and brought him to the brink of death per All Mights admission.  

&gt;Even in the kamino fight against an all might that was holding back a lot he still lost

And it took all the power All Might had left to defeat him not to mention it was a significant ly weakened version of All for One

Fuck dio brando literally monologue even more completely ignoring the fact that his ability is just a couple of second long, but do you see anyone complaining about that..? No… why..? Because it’s dumb complaint

No, it's not a dumb complaint because unlike most other villains who are monologuing, AFO was on an explicit time limit. In fact, Hawks even says that he was trying to get AFO to monologue to waste his time and AFO was so much of an idiot he fell right into that trap.  There are more panels of AFO monologuing then there are of him throwing attacks so yes he's been wasting a large portion of his time monologuing and is conintinuously failing to get away or permanently incapacitate the top heroes despite trying to multiple times.

Yes. After receiving his quirks back, he is still walking.

He was getting fucking manhandled in that fight, and he got bailed out by his quirks.

Let me make this cripplingly obvious for you. If Deku showed up at the beginning, everything up to chapter 369 would be roughly the same except it would occur earlier in time, right?

Tell me, how do you think Shiggy is getting out of the situation he finds himself in at the end of chapter 369 without Erasure being removed?

&gt;3.Fanwork-relevant rules
&gt;
&gt;•All fanwork must link directly to the artist/source in the original post. Linking it in the comments is not valid; you must POST the link to the source as your submission. Only 1 fanwork post per day, per user, is allowed. If you want to post multiple artworks, submit an album instead (using imgur for example)
&gt;
&gt;•If it's your own creation, please mention it in the title or comments.
&gt;
&gt;•Mark the post as spoiler if necessary. Spoiler is defined as events that are not adapted in the anime yet.
&gt;
&gt;•NSFW/lewd fanwork is not allowed. This includes, but not limited to: sexually suggestive poses/clothing/words or innuendos, or anything that makes the character look OOC for the sake of looking lewd. For example, drawing Momo in her Hero costume is fine, but drawing Momo in a suggestive pose while wearing her costume is not.
&gt;
&gt;**•Post only completed fanwork. Doodles, sketches, and work-in-progress are not allowed.** This includes line art without shading and most cases of whiteboard art. These are considered low-effort art.
&gt;
&gt;•Redraws of other people’s fanart are not allowed, but redraws from official artwork (manga, promos, anime) are allowed, provided they're not low-effort art.
&gt;
&gt;•For cosplay, if the character being cosplayed can't be recognized without the post title, it will not be allowed. This is considered low-effort cosplay.
&gt;
&gt;•All fanwork includes but not limited to: fanart, cosplay, edits, amvs, fanfiction

Again, please wait until your cosplay is totally finished and put together before posting. Updates on a cosplay is considered a WIP and we don't allow those.",,new66,False,False,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'THUNDERDOME CHAMP'}]",False,{},,,False,False,True,t3_11escqc,,dark,False,/r/BokuNoHeroAcademia/comments/11escqc/working_on_my_dark_deku_cosplay_part_2/jahaylc/,public,False,THUNDERDOME CHAMP,[],1677675774,r/BokuNoHeroAcademia,0,transparent,,moderator,1677691644,1677691644,95873358e3463d4dd86f69e8f89a906ffb442e74,2023-03-01 13:02:54,1.0,,

Toga not being able to use the leagues quirks is bullshit. She is using Twices quirk and he doesn't need to love them to use their quirks.

Also these Twice clones are so pathetic they might as well not be there since they don't manage to actually do anything.

Now Tokoyami's attack didn't work...that's good but now the question is why didn't AFO use that explosion attack on the heroes? Why isn't he just using it again right now to clear them all out? I guess AFO isn't allowed to actually do anything considering he hasn't killed a single hero.

Machia is back and being controlled...first of all we now know Kirishima succeeds in his area which means the others do as well so that was spoiled for us just like Uaraka failing to stop Toga. Next how is Shinso doing this? His power doesn't allow him to make people do complex things right so how is he doing this with Machia or making Machia use his quirks? And finally what is stopping AFO from just using that explosion attack again and just blasting them all off Machia's head and jolting Machia freeing him from the brainwashing?

I don't mind Endeavor being able to actually threaten AFO despite being little more than a nuisance before - the nature of his power allows him to punch above his weight to begin with, the ""a level 50 can't progress as quickly as a level 1"" was thrown out of the window ages ago and at the very least you would expect someone like Endeavor to just get stronger and stronger as well as learn from experience.

He may certainly have lost a lot of what he had stocked up once again, but he's still capable of unleashing a barrage of quirks.

Stuff like Jiro's talk no Jutsu actually doing something is just really odd from a somewhat logical perspective, and realistically AFO should be able to ignore all but two or three people at most from the current scene.

The Full Gauntlet in *Two Heroes* was just a prototype that Melissa made. It's not a brand new item for Deku to constantly use.

As for *Heroes Rising*, you watched it at the wrong time. While the movie was released during Season 4, it's actually set sometime during Season 5. This is an issue with Season 5, as there are two arcs that the anime switched the order of. The two arc, titled ""Meta Liberation Army"" and ""Endeavor's Agency"" are ordered respectively in the manga. Whereas the anime flipped the two's airing. 

*Heroes Rising* is meant to take place after the MLA arc but before Endeavor's Agency. This is set up by two pieces of dialogue in the manga, though only one is retained in the anime. Basically, when you hear a character mention ""the Hero Commission's other program,"" that would be the time to watch the movie.

As for why nothing is mentioned for the movie, it's because Bakugo doesn't remember. Only Deku and All Might remember the transfer happened. It doesn't really matter, though, since everything returned back to normal at the end. As for the Provisional License for Todoroki and Bakugo, watch the rest of Season 5.

I see where this is going now:

In the sequel series, My Sky Academia, Deku and Uraraka are a well known and powerful superhero duo who work well together. They have a kid whose quirk has been late to manifest, and they send her off to UA, which remained suspended in the sky, and was renamed to Sky Academia. There the kid after demonstrating no aptitude in testing, is placed in the Support course.

She makes friends with her fellow weak quirked students in the course with her. Including a gentle young man who can manipulate plants but doesnt like to show it.(Plant guy, likes her)

Along the way, she discovers she is not as powerless as she thought, and actually inherited some super strength from OFA(which only remained as regular super strength quirk, after it was used to stop AFO, losing the other quirks). She discovers her quirk when confronting Dabis daughter in P.E. class, after she had been bullied.

  
With her newfound quirk, she is moved to the Hero course and starts to become more popular, especially with her well known parents. She meets a handsome young man who she immediately develops a crush on.

She gradually abandons her friends in the support course, and joins the more popular hero course clique with the young man. He even invites her to the upcoming homecoming dance, and they start going out.

The Young man ends up holding a party with her at her house while her parents are not home, and since he is such a huge fan of her parents, she ends up showing them their secret bunker where they keep memorabilia from their hero days.

After learning handsome guy ruined the friendship with plant guy, she breaks up with handsome guy and refuses to go to the dance. While moping, she discovers that something is missing from the parents bunker, and sees the handsome guy in a old picture. She realizes he is the guy in the old picture of villains.

So she enlists the help of the Quirkless flying bus driver to go to Sky Academia to stop the handsome guy. Her parents who are honored as famous Alumni at the dance are the target.

The handsome guy(villain) reveals his true identity as AFO, and is enraged at the humiliation he had to endure by growing up a second time. He uses the item he stole, one of Eri's reversal bullets, to sentence all the people there, Alumni and students alike, to restarting as children like he had been left following his battle in My Hero Academia. He would plan to then brainwash them and raise them as Villains. And to eliminate any traces of his actions, he sabotaged the flying engine to cause the school to plummet.

The ~~sidekicks~~ support course students, whom had escaped, work with the main character to help her stop AFOs plan. She confronts AFO and attempts to stop him, but is thrown out the window to die. However she discovers that instead of dying, she is among the rare few who have a second quirk, and she also got the ability to fly/float. She uses that ability with her strength, to slow Sky Academias descent, while her ~~sidekick~~ support friends restore the flying engine. Plant guy decides to unleash his true powers to stop AFOs minions.

In the end, Sky Academia is saved, Plant guy and her get together, and the ~~sidekick~~ support students get a hero award for their efforts. Bus driver falls into a radioactive vat, and accomplishes his dream to be a hero with his mutated quirk he acquired.

He's no 1 recommended student in his year. Same as Momo at UA. 

&gt;Suneater had everything but fighting ability really holding him back until recently. He is #2 at the school and further into his career so he would naturally be higher ranked, and also he’s probably working with Lemillion.

The UA Big 3 ranking is for 3rd years only. So it's not a school-wide ranking that would necessarily predict the future.

Chisaki still has the quirk factor inside his body, he's just unable to use it due to having no arms.

As for AFO not stealing it - 1.) Did he have the time to do so? When breaking out of prison that's what he needed to concentrate on. After that, his ploy with Shiggy is what mattered.

2.) Did he know about Chisaki's quirk? Sure, Shiggy had some history with him, but AFO was in jail by that point and it probably wasn't the most pressing matter.

Obviously Eri's rewind has been limited to keep it out of the picture for the most part for several reasons. That said, we technically already have duplicated/copied quirks in the series due to other circumstances.

As for people calling for Overhaul to be rewound because they want to see literally everyone feature again, I actually find that a bit obnoxious. A little girl, 6, 7 years old, tortured for months, maybe for years  and barely out of that traumatic situation for a few months is supposed to already face the one responsible for it all and use her limited power, her stored up energy just like that to restore him?

That's grotesque and unrealistic. Sure, sometimes forgiveness is part of a healing process, but, again, we are talking about a traumatised 7 year old girl here with barely any time passed. And even then, forgiveness would be one thing, but forgoing the possibility to help someone dear to her in order to restore the one responsible for all the bad stuff that happened to her is another thing.

AFO for some reason is not killing anyone. This is the is your prime, mf?

I don't think you can argue that AFO isn't just nerfed here.

Also i like AFO turning into a teenager. A more fitting form for a useless manchild like him.

It was somehow hinted in MVA that Toga doesn't actually truly love Dabi (a girl loving a man that gives 0 shit about her and only ever had a positive interaction with her to promote his own goals? that's too classic for my taste) and Shigaraki.

You see, the introvert is a homebody who recharges his energies indoors and in comfort zones, expends a lot of energy when he goes out.  
A clear example would be when class 1A reviewed each of the bedrooms to choose the best room. Bakugou went to sleep, Shoto and Tokoyami spoke only when necessary, Shoto was sleepy all the time and wanted to leave quickly, staying only for commitment.

I'm glad HK remembered the conditions for Toga and that those conditions remained in place even when she transformed into Twice.

1. Toga creates clones of Shigaraki, Dabi, and AFO, but they can't use their Quirks because Toga can only use the Quirks of those she genuinely loves (Which was established beforehand during her fight with Uraraka in the last war).

2. Speaking of Uraraka, she finally gets her moment and fights her way through a horde of Twice clones to reach Toga. Looks like the Toga Talk No Jutsu is well underway.

3. As I predicted, Tokoyami proves to be unable to stop AFO. And because he has wasted so much time, he ends up rewinding into a teenager. AFO tries to fly away and Gigantomachia arrives. It looks like things are finally going in AFO's favor... or not. Turns out the heroes managed to get Gigantomachia on their side with the help of Shinsou's Brainwashing Quirk. Once again, AFO takes another L. Guy officially has the worst luck in the world.

The chapter begins with Hawks and All for One realizing that the current situation hasn't gotten as good for the villains/bad for the heroes as it could get, because Toga still hasn't used her full power. That's when she starts making clones of Shigaraki, Dabi and AFO.

We see that Shigaraki's clone tries to use decay but nothing happens. Cut to the girls and Tsuyu says that she has a hypothesis: if Toga transformed into the other league members at the start and made clones of them, things would be over already. There must be a condition.

This condition has to do with what she told Ochako in the last war, about using the quirks of people she love. Clones created by Toga must still follow that rule, and she doesn't love the league members enough. Twice could make the clones use their quirks, but Toga can't.

Ochako starts to wonder how Toga must be feeling about this and we see that she really is unwell. She says she does love Toya and Tomura, but she can't use their powers. She already knew it because she tested it beforehand, but she thought things could've changed.

She starts crying saying that Jin would've been able to do it and wondering why she can't fully become him. What follows is a black double spread with only speech bubble saying ""exterminate all the heroes"", the line the Twice clones have been repeating.

And then comes another double spread, this time of Ochako fighting the Twice clones. She thinks to herself ""I always loved seeing people happy, that's why I can't ignore your tears"". She then looks at the original Toga, who's crying while transformed into Twice.

Cut back to Tokoyami and he's still attacking AFO. Hawks tells him to hold on as long as he can until AFO's body is gone. Jiro tells the heroes to attack Dark Shadow to make it stronger, Camie creates an aurora night sky and Inasa gives support with his wind.

But it's useless, because a big explosion comes from where he was. Dark Shadow is sent back and All for One says that these strong types are the most annoying to deal with. This is when we see that he looks much younger now, almost like a teenager, but still menacing.

He attacks the heroes with some sort of black tendrils and starts flying away. Some heroes like Inasa try to go after him, but the worst was yet to come: All for One smiles as he sees Gigantomachia on the horizon, coming towards him.

All for One gives an order for him to destroy the remaining heroes, but then Hawks says ""the situation is actually better than it seems, right, Tsukauchi?"". At this moment, Machia throws an entire mountain at All for One.

The last page shows Kirishima all wounded on the top of Machia's head, shouting ""We're here too, Tokoyami! We won't let him get to Midoriya!"". And next to him is SHINSOU using his Persona Chords!

Given Nagant was already in prison by Ch. 1 of MHA and Hawks was seen being recruited as a child, it’s safe to assume Hawks had been on his mission of uncovering the MLA for a long time before all these problems arise.

The League didn’t become relevant until they raided USJ w the first Nomu and AFO had been in hiding for three years before Kamino, since the fight that permanently injured All Might.

I’m just theorizing but, that’s probably when Hawks mission shifted to infiltrating the League. They wouldn’t waste their best hero on some teenagers… but some teenagers with the ability to draw AFO out of hiding? Different ball game.

&gt;3.Fanwork-relevant rules
&gt;
&gt;•All fanwork must link directly to the artist/source in the original post. Linking it in the comments is not valid; you must POST the link to the source as your submission. Only 1 fanwork post per day, per user, is allowed. If you want to post multiple artworks, submit an album instead (using imgur for example)
&gt;
&gt;•If it's your own creation, please mention it in the title or comments.
&gt;
&gt;•Mark the post as spoiler if necessary. Spoiler is defined as events that are not adapted in the anime yet.
&gt;
&gt;•NSFW/lewd fanwork is not allowed. This includes, but not limited to: sexually suggestive poses/clothing/words or innuendos, or anything that makes the character look OOC for the sake of looking lewd. For example, drawing Momo in her Hero costume is fine, but drawing Momo in a suggestive pose while wearing her costume is not.
&gt;
&gt;**•Post only completed fanwork. Doodles, sketches, and work-in-progress are not allowed.** This includes line art without shading and most cases of whiteboard art. These are considered low-effort art.
&gt;
&gt;•Redraws of other people’s fanart are not allowed, but redraws from official artwork (manga, promos, anime) are allowed, provided they're not low-effort art.
&gt;
&gt;•For cosplay, if the character being cosplayed can't be recognized without the post title, it will not be allowed. This is considered low-effort cosplay.
&gt;
&gt;•All fanwork includes but not limited to: fanart, cosplay, edits, amvs, fanfiction

Feel free to post the cosplay once it is fully finished and put together, until then WIP pieces are not allowed.",,new66,False,False,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'THUNDERDOME CHAMP'}]",False,{},,,False,False,True,t3_11erzu6,,dark,False,/r/BokuNoHeroAcademia/comments/11erzu6/update_my_guys_on_dark_deku_suit/jafsmyl/,public,False,THUNDERDOME CHAMP,[],1677639425,r/BokuNoHeroAcademia,0,transparent,,moderator,1677695648,1677695649,e570ecb6fb9bf7786b9ad1cca581c5850784bbd5,2023-03-01 02:57:05,1.0,,

OFA is sentient at this point, choosing to remain in Midoriya. That's why, when Horikoshi wrote the movie, he had it set around where the manga was at the time instead of around Season 4 of the anime.

The following is an excerpt from Horikoshi's interview about the movie: 

&gt;By the way, due to the length of the movie we weren’t able to show all of it, but there’s a reason none of One For All’s power was left with Bakugo. In the timeline where the movie is, the will of the predecessors has started to interfere with things.

Shoto is unaware of this though since he never observed how his siblings interacted (and was also way too young to interpret those complex feelings correctly).

Other than Mirio but in the same location, I'm also surprised by the panel count of Best Jeanist. Did he really get more than Toga, Ochako and Tokoyami? Even Aizawa? Maybe he got boosted for appearing near Bakugou's corpse or something lol.

Looking at your numbers, it looks like the character with most visibility until now has actually been AFO: 196 in Shiggy's body, 118 in the old one. He's been the main player on the two most important front basically? I wouldn't be surprised if he stays at the top too - he's probably going to continue his mayhem in the present until near the end and there's also some backstory in-coming.

I wonder if Shouto will end up with more panels in the end than Bakugou-awake-only? Probably not lol.

Dude's the kind of villain who fucks around because not only does he LOVE it and being the centre of attention, but he doesn't think he can lose.

Eh people over hype erasure. Apart from being useless to pre-rewound AFO because he had no eyes, it's probably not actually that OP against multiple heroes. Blinking immediately ruins it, and its effects only work on the person you at looking at directly. Plus whether it can be used without shutting off the users' other quirks is unknown. 

\&gt;My problem now is that his plan isn't falling apart yet, he can still easily win with his Prime All Might tier abilities. He just.... doesn't.

His plan fell apart completely the moment Shigaraki overcame the OG AFO vestige, asserted his will and made clear he doesn't care about stealing OFA. Also easily win is a bit much imo. Deku and Shigaraki should be strong enough individually to defeat Prime AFO. 

I'll never get the he just doesn't criticism. Because AFO's whole thing is he's so arrogant and cruel that he constantly shoots himself in the foot and can't help himself. For the past century he has had countless opportunities to ensure he ruins unchecked but he keeps failing to do so because of his obsession with getting OFA and being hated by everyone. His treatment of Yoichi and disregard for his brother's autonomy ensured OFA existed and that it's wielders HATE and oppose him. His use of Tomura ensured his usurpation by a far more dangerous villain. He lost to All Might the second time because he kept pressing his buttons and trying to hurt civilians, and under-estimated All Might's ability to deceive him, which only inspired All Might to out-manuever him and win. His programming Kurogiri to prioritize Tomura's wellbeing utterly fucked him. And his need to secure New Order allowed Star and Stripe to destroy several quirks. And he consistently underestimates everyone around him. He underestimated Yoichi's and his successor's heroic drive to overcome him. He underestimated All Might both times and he underestimated Deku's strength of character. It makes sense to me that he's doing this because the guy always pulls this kind of crap. 

AFO's not winning because he fundamentally doesn't think he can lose. He doesn't get that playing with his food, monologuing, and wasting time is costing him because to him the idea that he doesn't win is impossible.",,,False,False,[],False,{},,,False,False,True,t3_11e8ycs,,,False,/r/BokuNoHeroAcademia/comments/11e8ycs/curiouswhat_would_you_guys_say_is_afos_biggest/jad9d9x/,public,False,,[],1677602296,r/BokuNoHeroAcademia,0,,,,1677602312,1677602313,c3416945572480ea13cae57f299cdc50e4b550a4,2023-02-28 16:38:16,,,

Arguably both overwhelming will and out-of-control quirk:

Rather than making the single perfect nomu, I thought it'd be fun to see how several different quirks could complement each other. On a side note, I think this is how Izuku would design nomu if he were evil. 


AOE Nomu
Gigantification
Dupli Arms
Tail Splitter
Creation
Poltergeist
Gigantification adds ridiculous force to any body part moving via tail splitter. Dupli arms and tail splitter allow them to create and weaponize more body parts as well as extend any scouting radius. All three of these working in tandem allow creation to become even more powerful and versatile from not only more body mass and surface but the ability to create things away from the main body. Poltergeist and tail splitter would allow them to use any created object from a much greater range than either quirk could independently. 

Sniper Nomu 
Zoom
Erasure
Creation
Homing
Dupli Arms
Zoom would allow them to use erasure on targets up to 5k away. Creation would allow them to make weapons on the fly, such as sniper rifles. Using zoom and honing in tandem would allow perfect aim and erasure would prevent the target's quirk from protecting them. For close combat, dupli arms would allow them to create multiple eyes that could track different targets and blink at separate times allowing them to use erasure indefinitely, theoretically. Dupli arms would also expand the area creation could work from without sacrificing the safety of the torso.

Stealth nomu
Invisibility 
Permeation
Erasure
Somnambulist
Energy drain
Invisibility and permeation would allow the nomu to go anywhere without being detected. Since these quirks aren't great for combat against the top ten, erasure and somnambulist prevent the targets from resisting. Energy drain would allow the nomu to continue fighting for long periods of time against multiple opponents if discovered. 

Melee nomu
Harden
Scales
Razor Sharp
Dupli Arms
Tail
The first three would complement each other beautifully, as well as allow dupli arms and tail to have a stronger defense and offense. Harden is a powerful shield that is superior to scales, but scales is more versatile. Razor sharp is a powerful weapon, and scales would allow it to become long-range. 

Vampire nomu
Transformation
Blood curdle
Blood control
Manual's water manipulation quirk
Transformation is already an s teir quirk with Toga's recent breakthrough. Keeping with the blood theme, they already have to consume it to transform, bloodcurdle would render their victim immobile as well. When blood control is combined with water manipulation, the user can manipulate all blood, not just their own. This would allow them to easily steal blood without risking their safety as much before the transformation. 

Glutton nomu
Chimera
Manifest
Food
Copy
Food quirk would allow the nomu to consume anything instantly allowing them to manifest the qualities quickly. By eating people, copy and manifest would allow them to have a longer-lasting copy of their victim's quirk. Chimera's compatibility with manifest and copy is unpredictable, but the idea is that it would allow the changes to become either permanent or able to activate at will. 

Siren nomu
Confession 
Brainwash
Earjacks
Voice
Dupli arms
Confession would force any victim to answer, even if they knew the effects of brainwashing beforehand. Earjacks and voice would have great synergy, with earjacks allowing voice to target more accurately. Dupli arms and earjacks are both perfect for scouting and combined, the range of detection as well as what could be detected would increase. Dupli arms and voice would allow large and powerful aoe attacks rather than the more focused attacks we see Present Mic use. Voice could also be used to allow a much greater amount of people to hear and respond to confession before becoming ensnared by brainwashing. 

Angst nomu
Hellflame
Frost
Enji wanted to beat the no 1 with his fire and sought to use Rei's ice to become more powerful. The masterpiece he hoped to realize with the birth of Shouto come to fruition in a terrifying parody of Shouto's half-hot half-cold.

1. I think the implication was that following what happened with Nagant, the higher-ups in society shifted away from handling things that way, since it seemed like they didn't make Hawks go around extra-judicially executing heroes who risked undermining society's faith in the HPSC. Still made him do some dirty/shady stuff as necessary, but not to that extent. 
2. There's also the conversation from the Tartarus breakout episode where the one guy advocated for just murdering Machia, but the other guard's response to it made it seem that was an outlier opinion and that there would be outrage if the public found out they were even considering things like that. Which was probably true in the past as well with Nagant's doings, but the guard in Tartarus mentions everything in there is recorded and would potentially become public knowledge. So they probably wouldn't be able to cover it up as easily. 
3. There's also the third (but perhaps less likely) reason of All For One having taken steps himself to ensure his safety, such as just being too difficult to kill or maybe even having paid off higher-ups in some way to keep himself safe. 
4. The last (and maybe most important) reason, the public simply wasn't aware of how much of a threat All For One is. He's been around forever, but it's not like he's a mythical villain everyone's heard of and knows how dangerous he is. It's pretty much solely One For All's inheritors and their confidants who are aware of the threat All For One represents. It wasn't until very recently in the story (post Bakugo kidnapping) that even the police force became aware that All For One was a major threat and decided not to treat the League of Villains with kid gloves because of their connection to him. The public at large is not aware All For One even exists and what kind of threat he poses to all of hero society, so the people who run Tartarus probably were not aware of how much of a threat he was, thereby not having any reason/motivation to just off him for safety's sake.",,,False,False,[],False,{},,,False,False,True,t3_11bhwo5,,,False,/r/BokuNoHeroAcademia/comments/11bhwo5/my_hero_academia_season_6_episode_21_anime_only/jab9jq8/,public,False,,[],1677558593,r/BokuNoHeroAcademia,0,,,,1677558604,1677558604,7c8f0a1caf5d58f772d5e9aef3e61f2de68c4549,2023-02-28 04:29:53,,,

&gt;3.Fanwork-relevant rules
&gt;
&gt;**•All fanwork must link directly to the artist/source in the original post. Linking it in the comments is not valid; you must POST the link to the source as your submission.** Only 1 fanwork post per day, per user, is allowed. If you want to post multiple artworks, submit an album instead (using imgur for example)
&gt;
&gt;•If it's your own creation, please mention it in the title or comments.
&gt;
&gt;•Mark the post as spoiler if necessary. Spoiler is defined as events that are not adapted in the anime yet.
&gt;
&gt;•NSFW/lewd fanwork is not allowed. This includes, but not limited to: sexually suggestive poses/clothing/words or innuendos, or anything that makes the character look OOC for the sake of looking lewd. For example, drawing Momo in her Hero costume is fine, but drawing Momo in a suggestive pose while wearing her costume is not.
&gt;
&gt;**•Post only completed fanwork. Doodles, sketches, and work-in-progress are not allowed.** This includes line art without shading and most cases of whiteboard art. These are considered low-effort art.
&gt;
&gt;•Redraws of other people’s fanart are not allowed, but redraws from official artwork (manga, promos, anime) are allowed, provided they're not low-effort art.
&gt;
&gt;•For cosplay, if the character being cosplayed can't be recognized without the post title, it will not be allowed. This is considered low-effort cosplay.
&gt;
&gt;•All fanwork includes but not limited to: fanart, cosplay, edits, amvs, fanfiction

&gt;6.No Shipping
&gt;
&gt;Rule is in effect to prevent shipwars.
&gt;
&gt;**No shipping-related discussion, fanwork, or any kind of posts.

Both are more a plot device than full fleshed characters, but Nagant at least had a conection with Deku. Also, her story adds a lot to the worldbuilding of the series, but it was done in a terrible way. With more screentime, Nagant still has potential to be at least a nice character.

Sns is just a plot device to nerf Shigaraki and in my opinion, one of the lowest points of the series. In general, she adds nothing and even her supposed relationship with All Might is not important. Her quirk is more a problem than an interesting ability too. Also, and this is personal, but if you are from the US, maybe SnS means something to you. But as someone that is not from there, at sometimes SnS is borderline a parody that I can't take serious. I understand what Hori tried to do with her, but it didn't work at all.

I really like SnS's physical appearence (not her costume) because it's really different from what we are used to, but also understand why Nagant is far more popular.

I think the perfect way for his arc to end is to realize that he’ll do anything to become the friend he always should have been to Izuku. To embody the qualities of All Might’s charisma that makes people feel safe. To be a hero that can, despite his personality, bring hope to people. 

Bakugo has always been powerful and talented. His growth should be expressed mainly in emotionally maturing and becoming a more complete character. Putting aside his petty rivalry and need to be the best is part of that.

And they do have a connection through OFA and AOF plus Nana shimura and all might, so to say they don’t have any connection to each other disingenuous. Did Eren stop feeling like the main character when barely had screen time in season 4 part 1? 

Also WTF does him not being able to beat shigaraki has anything to do with anything? He was at the front of the battle which would’ve been lost if Midoriya wasn’t there. In fact all the heroes would have died without him present. 

Also Midoriya has been connected to each villain he has fought throughout the story. Eri &amp; Overhaul. Shigaraki AFO &amp; All Might. Stain &amp; Iida and All Might. Muscular &amp; the one kid.

I'd say he's very similar to a lot of other manga protagonists in being ridiculously overpowered and basically leaving side-characters obsolete in battle. Which, I too, find pretty annoying. But certainly he's no outlier in that regard. Ichigo, Naruto and a ton of other protagonist basically had the same thing going on. I would say that Deku getting new powers was actually foreshadowed pretty early on. The first hint I remember being during Deku's fight with Shinsou during the sports festival. Which is pretty early on in the story as it's one of the first arcs. And at least the manga does give an in-universe explanation to explain why All-might didn't have these powers (and therefor couldn't have told Izuku about them). That being said All Might was incredibly overpowered as a hero. That's pretty much established in universe and a huge chunk of the show is written around that fact. Like All-might being OP leading to other heroes slacking and losing their way, as well as leading to a huge chunk of problems when All-Might can no longer play his part as the symbol of peace. The power difference between him and other heroes was significant, therefor he was the only one who stood a chance against AFO. So at least in that way it makes sense that no one else is able to realistically go toe to toe with AFO or Shimura. Except of course the character who, in theory, should become as powerful as All-Might due to having the same power. So while it is a bit annoying. I do think that at least in this show it was written into the plot and makes sense in an in-universe kind of way. Personally I kind of wish that they had stretched the story out over a longer period of time. Rather than make this a story that played out in Izuku's first year. It would have been less jarring if it had happened over the entire three years he was supposed to be at UA. That seems like a (slightly) more reasonable time to become more powerful than All-Might and unlock the rest of his powers. I guess they didn't want to have to write the same things repeatedly like the sports festival etc? But yeah in general it's hard to avoid this problem when it's basically a whole story about an incredibly overpowered hero being defeated and having to pass on his powers in order that his student can become overpowered enough to defeat the enemy that got him. Outside of stretching the time-line the only other thing would have been to make All-Might less powerful from the start. But that has always kind of been his whole 'thing' so the plot wouldn't really work if you toned that down too much.!&lt;",,,False,False,[],False,{},,,False,False,True,t3_11d05p0,,,False,/r/BokuNoHeroAcademia/comments/11d05p0/just_started_deku_deserves_better/ja9a783/,public,False,,[],1677528253,r/BokuNoHeroAcademia,0,,,,1677528274,1677528274,187ac14d19c893966649ecf8d75dbdbc609fccc9,2023-02-27 20:04:13,,,

Why then do we see him getting the Golden Age suit when Melissa is 4 only for him to be in the Silver Age suit for 72 hours straight in *Vigilantes*?

The flashback in *Vigilantes* takes place when Nighteye and All Might are still a team. They started working together 11 years prior to *Two Heroes*. At the very youngest, Melissa would be 6 years old when All Might and Nighteye began their partnership.

Yet All Might is using the Silver Age suit when he only received *a* (not *the*, like you're suggesting) Golden Age suit two years prior to that. He wouldn't just go from the Gold to Silver to Gold Age again. Because Ages don't work like that.

Him having the costume would mean that it's that age. Him going to a brand new costume makes it that new costume's age. I don't see why you claim that he wouldn't be in his Golden Age when he debuts. Immediately after All Might's debut, crime each year began to diminish. It was All Might's debut that led to a decrease in crime. I don't see how that isn't considered to be a ""Golden Age"".

What's more, it follows not only the Comic ages, but the Ages of Man. We started with Gold, then Silver, then Bronze, then Heroic, and finally Iron. Horikoshi's story has contradictions in it, there's no getting around it. But simply making things up doesn't help anyone.

Also, if All Might was only interested in being in the best possible suit, why would he ever wear Silver again?

Like, I'm not sure where you're getting the information that All Might's debut suit was destroyed and then he moved on to Bronze. 

The comic ages that the suit names are based on didn't suddenly go from Gold to Bronze to Silver and then back to Gold again.

There is no vested interest for Nana in that very moment. It is literally the biggest waste what she did. She gives her power to All Might and then goes to fight AFO. She never trains All Might and doesn’t stick around to raise kid. She sheds the one thing keeping him in pursuit of her and then runs to get slaughtered for literally no reason. She could’ve easily passed along the power and then gone into hiding just like All Might did (and look what happened when he did and was able to train Deku).

I couldn’t disagree more with this Nana is a Nobel character nonsense. She is easily one of the most flawed characters in the whole series. Her fear of the “what if” made her chose an emotional and poor decision. Gran Torino also falls in this category but at least he survived long enough to redeem himself and everyone get to know it. Nana’s redemption comes in the after life.

For Nana it doesn’t make sense to leave already vulnerable people without any way to protect themselves, when you’ve gotten rid of the one thing that was endangering them. It at the very least would be different if she left him with Gran Torino and not told him to stay out of their lives. By not giving their kid a reason as to why you abandoned them not only will made him hate them/not respect their sacrifice anyway. 

The “leave my loved ones behind and sacrifice myself when no one asked me to” is literally a failed character flaw known as a martyr complex. It’s not a good idea and has a name within literature and psychology for a reason. No one said, “Nana go sacrifice yourself in final battle and seek out AFO to make it happen.” she had plenty of choices and good ones at that but decided on the “heroic” one because retiring likely was too much of burden on her. It was supposed to be All Mights battle from then on and she decided to not hang it up. Dying as punishment for a very foolish decision.

Nana created the problem and literally confessed to it. So does Gran Torino. Imagine if they had stuck around and managed to survive having all heroes on their side. Then Shigi is brought up in the hero society and AFO literally doesn’t stand a chance. The only reason he can be so OP in Shigi’s body is because Shigi’s Quirk is absolutely broken. Nana gave up on the idea that even her own offspring might be able to save the day eventually. She didn’t even believe in herself or her family enough to stick around. There wouldn’t even be a need to have been a Deku because they would’ve finished AFO off before Deku ever would’ve been old enough to go to school. 

Her folly was thinking that she needed to sacrifice herself when she already had passed on the power. Her sticking around likely erases the entire timeline and her forcibly injecting herself back into the conflict was merely based off her assumption that AFO would follow her after passing on the quirk because there there hadn’t been a predecessor and successor around at the same time to predict how AFO would move and react. She lacked the composure and patience to find out; and let the fear of potentially losing her child turn butterfly effect into evil incarnate.

It’s hilarious to me that no one seems to see why they all stick to Midoriya so hard now. They left both Dabi and Shigi to their own devices and now they are the two of greatest foes the world has seen standing by the enemy #1 in a final battle they have to throw teenagers at to win.

&gt;!If I go with the personal side. I discovered the anime in a time where I was working for my University exam. There was still like a year or so but the fear was keep building and building. !&lt;

&gt;!I just watch the anime because superheros and anime. Why not? It would be fun time.!&lt;

&gt;!First four episodes was not that tho. To me Izuku's origin with those episodes still one of the best told stories in the anime and it hit me more than any of the other stories in MHA.!&lt;

&gt;!I look at Todoroki's story or any other story and I love them a lot but those first four eppisodes actually connected with me. It wasn't some tragedy that made Izuku a hero. He was just a normal person. There wasn't an Uncle Ben, at best he was just bullied. So seeing this normal kid going through all the things he did in the first episode his life seemingly getting worse and worse with all his expectations of himself crumble only for it to hit to breaking point with a villian escaping for his causing. !&lt;

&gt;!Yes the next thing that will happen might be cliche but seeing what he did made me actually emotional(dub version of these scene is better fight me-). And it wasn't that he suddenly got powerful to beat that villian. He didn't stand a chance but it hit me hard. Especially because the entire hero deal was acted in these series as a school, a future people try to achive and seeing Izuku at that moment made me feel closer to him than any other character in the future.!&lt;

&gt;!And after All Might agreeing to take him on to the time he got into the school made me just see him as one of my fav heroes.!&lt;

&gt;!And I will be real I never really got that from any other anime. Tbf MHA was one of the first ones I watched after... Jojo.... Anyways-!&lt;

&gt;!But I genuinly couldn't find any other story that hit me like Deku's did even after I started watchin other animes. He just felt more human to me than most characters.!&lt;

&gt;!And while I do love me some tragic stories and backstories, I never really see them like I saw Izuku.!&lt;

&gt;!For anime watching him grow from cowardly but brave kid from season 1 to a brave and a strong hero from season 4 and after that more grounded symbol for ""people"" in manga is just amazing to me. I do wish somethings were different of course but he remained the character I cared the most.!&lt;

&gt;!For side characters tho. While I do think they were used fine. I do wish some were given more time. Like Uraraka or Iida.!&lt;

We know where it's going and how it will end. But I've enjoyed that story getting livened up by the introduction of more and more characters that fill up Deku's world and keep things interesting. Too often I feel like writers try to make big casts work but just can't seem to find a balance. Either there are a bunch of people who distract us from the main plot who we don't care about. Or we do actually have great side-characters but they only show up for a brief moment and then continue to do very little for the remainder of the story... kind of leaving me disappointing. I really like the balance MHA has achieved though. A great sidecast that gets a reasonable amount of attention, while also maintaining a reasonable pace for Deku's story to play out.

That’s why everyone begins to reject these heroes is because they can’t even keep their families under control and their relatives are the ones sowing chaos into society. You say it’s all because of OFA but the people of the story aren’t an omnipotent reader and know that.

Endeavor being the number 1 hero and showing the massive flaw of not being able to prevent an arch villain from being raised in his home. Endeavor is also responsible for him turning evil because of the way treated Dabi, and that hatred Endeavor sowed and cultivated in his son is a key piece to unraveling a society he so diligently maintained. Naturally it raised question of “wether or not he can lead/protect the masses if he can even lead his family?” Should be able to bring up other heroes if that’s how his son turned out?” Ultimately, he was only doing hero work to protect his honor and that’s something he actually admits. He literally takes responsibility for the massive error in front of reporters and apologizes to his family from a hospital bed.

Also, Hawks also owns up to all the crimes he had to commit and that he’s the son of a criminal and his lifestyle before becoming a hero was that of a thief. He’s the example of once again, bad parenting and how the abuse of the home could have led him to being a villain. He just got lucky and was picked up by and hero agency first. He also admits that in his inner dialogue. He’s not corrupt in the I do bad things but he definitely plays a chaotic neutral which is not something the public would call “heroic.” He’s a shady figure in their minds because he does dirty work to get results.

Now, Nana has the ability to fucking fly and Gran Torino is the fastest hero alive at the time. They absolutely could’ve ran and protected their kid at the same time. I promise you that her son would’ve rather been “in danger” and with his two top hero parents than abandon with little to no reason as to why. She never explained herself to him and neither did GT. It was a bad call and they both knew it then and really know it now. The flashback is her crying saying “we’ve made a huge mistake.” 

More proof…Shigi wouldn’t have become a villain and been stolen by AFO if they had stayed in his life and she told All Might about him. Grab Torino also could’ve told them but he chose to not because of their pride. He would’ve been raised by GT and Nana if they had chosen to stay apart of their sons life. Shigi’s dad also wouldn’t have rejected Shigi’s dream of becoming a hero and causing him spiral out as a kid. Nana and GT are not noble for abandoning their family to protect them. 

It was incredibly short sighted and Nana even says it was the wrong decision but she didn’t felt like she had a choice…but she did. She could’ve faced her biggest fear and been the hero of her family.

My proof that it’s not what she should’ve done? The entire arc airing right now is an allusion to that exact moment of Nana’s arc. Going rogue like Deku has and leaving your loved ones in the dark with only worries them into action and eventually pulls them into the problem regardless of your “I’ll do it own my own to protect you.” Class 1-A is Deku’s turf he’s trying to protect. He abandons them and that untimely leaves them more vulnerable and in more danger if AFO were to go after them. If he stays with them he can at least fight along side them instead of them all having to fight in their own respectively.

If they are such “great heroes” they should’ve stick around to protect and influence their children instead of running away and allowing the for more problems happened and arise. Leaving their families vulnerable and unprotected played right into AFO’s hands because he ends up with their grand kid in the end. It again, goes back to, “if they can’t even protect and influence their families then what good are the heroes really? They’re going produce powerful offspring and if they can’t keep them in line then we’d rather not have heroes at all.” 

The corruption isn’t like “oh this hero runs a drug ring on the side” because that’s lazy and creates not moral quandary. Now, a hero that doesn’t commit a crime, stops the most crimes in human history, but raises his child so portly that he chooses to and almost succeeds and destroying the thing he protects will make you wonder about how good of person that hero actually is.",,,False,False,[],False,{},,,False,False,True,t3_11ckdjh,,,False,/r/BokuNoHeroAcademia/comments/11ckdjh/what_do_you_think_is_the_biggest_missed/ja6sz89/,public,False,,[],1677481417,r/BokuNoHeroAcademia,0,,,,1677481430,1677481431,fb8774ec5f48bf7c74791fa856dc41eb6f8bf5f6,2023-02-27 07:03:37,,,

There's nothing pointing to other heroes not working hard enough, Endeavor was just that good.

&gt; He may have “stopped more crimes” but All Might always prevent imminent disaster. Everyone “accepted” he was the new #1 hero but endeavor learned quickly that being number didn’t mean surpassing All Might because didn’t inspire people like he did.

All Might preventing imminent disaster is literally what stopping crimes is. Endeavor objectively did more work than All Might did, the only difference is that All Might was better at inspiring people.

&gt; The show is literally painting the picture of “these heroes are good at being heroes but that doesn’t automatically make them good people.”

Okay but this only applies to Endeavor. No other hero is painted like this.

&gt; Nana could’ve passed her powers on and not been the target of AFO much like he doesn’t give a flying fuck about All Might now and only goes after Deku. 

She had already passed OFA off to All Might by the time she fought All For One. He stopped caring about All Might because All Might is no longer a threat to him. Nana was still very much a threat.

&gt;  Also, Gran Torino could’ve been around more. 

Nana specifically asked All Might and Gran Torino not to associate with her kid in anyway because it would rightfully draw attention to him.

&gt; They selfishly chose to have a child knowing that they probably wouldn’t be able to raise one.

Nana didn't think she'd have to give up her kid. It's only after her husband was murdered that she realized she had to give him up before he died too. 

&gt; That’s not something a hero does. Yet, they’ll parade around in capes with righteousness.

A hero doesn't sacrifice their own personal happiness to protect the ones they love from criminals who would kill them?

&gt; This is what they’re pointing at literally why society starts to reject the heroes. It’s quite literally the foundation of the last arc. Endeavor is corrupt and he’s #1. 

No, it's not. Endeavor isn't corrupt when it comes to being a hero, he's corrupt when it comes to being a father. He became the 2nd ranked hero because of how good he was at heroics. If he was a shitty hero then he wouldn't have been seen as the 2nd best.
