Manga I enjoyed:

Sousou no frieren

Reason: I was fascinated with the concept of long-life and it's side-effects. There were many small moments of wistfulness and melancholy that made this manga beautiful to me.

Love is war

Reason: Although there were many parts I was dissatisfied with, the Ice Kaguya arc and the character of Miyuki Shirogane really touched me. I liked the examination of what a human relationship really is and what it meant to open yourself, even if it means you could be hurt.

I am a hero

Reason: Even though the ending nearly ruined the whole manga for me, doing whatever it takes to survive was really a powerful idea to me. Meeting horrible people, doing terrible things to live another day. There were some points where I felt the author captured what it really means to be alive.

(Not a Manga) The inheritance cycle

Reason: When reading this book, there some points where I felt that the book was more real than reality itself. The world building was incredible. And there were many powerful lines that I still think about.

Manga I did not enjoy

Berserk

Reason: The art was mesmerizing. I loved the Golden Age and the idea of a lost soul desperately looking for purpose in life. However, once the supernatural elements really took off, the series devolved into a repetitive cycle of women being abused and Guts saving the day. It felt like an insult to my intelligence. No one likes insults to their intelligence.

That time I got reincarnated as a slime

Reason: The main character never suffered consequences for his actions.  I stopped reading after the author revived all of his subordinates... just because. I do not mind fantasy, but the story has to make sense.

I do not mind what genre manga is from. I only ask that the story makes sense and has some substance.",t2_701p5xq6,Manga Recommendations,1.0,False,self.manga,False,False,11gllqc,AutumnYellowo,0,1677802539,False,2023-03-03 00:15:39,"Manga Recommendations Looking for manga recommendations.

manga,"I'm all for supporting the artists and I want them to get their money. Coming up with a story, drawing it out and getting it published isn't easy and I know that some get paid dust, when they should be getting that bag. I do pay for manga services that are monthly based and I do buy manga too, but I really hate the coin system. It's just way too expensive. 

I get why this would be the ideal service, but I went to Manga Up and it costs 80 coins for an advance chapter, 40 coins for a regular one. To unlock everything would be more expensive than me buying a volume set. 

It just seems like a system that doesn't benefit the consumer. It's not just Manga Up too, Pocket Comics, Web Novel, etc... have this system down. Lots of Korean and Chinese series follow this route and considering how long some of those works are, you'll end up breaking the bank by the time you get to the end. Not to mention some Chinese stories just stop updating, so you pay all this money for an abandoned project.

I don't mind paying money for works or services and I do want to support the artists, but I also don't want to break the bank. If that makes sense. It would be nice if they offered a monthly service fee. But I'd imagine that the artists wouldn't be paid as much, so it's not ideal for them.

manga,"Hey guys,

I took a screenwriting class and my creative writing teacher was against flashbacks. She said that flashbacks took our attention away from the story. While she didn't outright tell us to not use them she seems to hint at using it less. Moreover, it seems in film they want to use Jaws' effect where the a character narrates the flashback and the no flashback is shown.

**Evidence #1:** Here's a film essay where the creator praises Silent of the Lambs  for having only two flashbacks :  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADhan4PTb\_o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADhan4PTb_o)

Naruto has a lot of flashbacks and its understandable some might be turned off by it. However, I see ample manga who use Flashbacks better than Naruto. In general, I think Mangaka and Anime Animators are more comfortable indulging in flashbacks. I watched the French film La Boum 2 and they had a small ""flashback montage"" when the main character is dancing. 

**My theory:** is that in Hollywood Films and American Comics: They are novelty seeking, it seems they always want something new as opposed to repeating an idea. This is connected to the concept of ""Subtlety."" For instance, when I was watching Gundam Wing I liked the recap since they helped me understood the anime better. But I notice some viewers didn't like the recaps since they were saying, ""We only need to see it once on the screen and we get it.""

-Fumetsu no Anata e (To Your Eternity)
-Violet Evergarden

Just friends?)

I have vivid memories of repeatedly reading this Manga. It was about a kid who's dad was dying (critical condition or otherwise) and he was reasonably extremely upset. Then a main in a suit comes up to him and tells him there's a way to save him if he travels to another world. So when he goes home he gets under his bed and says some phrase or falls asleep and he's transported to this other world, which I assume is the afterlife. He meets a group of animal people (the one I remember most clearly was a very kind rabbit guy who gave lots of sugar, which is the currency, to people in need) that help him get there. Then it's revealed that the suit guy is actually the main villain and turns into some kind of spider monster. He also meets his grandfather in kid form who also helps guide him.

manga,"(I don't usually post on reddit, so please let me know if I've mucked something up.)

I'm trying to remember the name of a manga I read...probably a decade ago, if I had to guess. I don't remember a lot of details, but I know reddit had a powerful collective memory, and like 2 hours of searching has gotten me nowhere. 

What I do remember: 

-- Maybe three main characters? A girl and two guys, one guy is very laid back/lackadaisical and the other is stuck up and annoyed by the first's behavior.

-- They're members of an organization, I think, that fights some sort of monster/creatures. I think the girl is new, and possibly the stuck up guy (although he might have been very good in training or something??). They're a three man team, iirc.

-- I don't remember much plot, but I remember one specific scene. The three are in a cave or tunnel or some sort and are trapped by too many monsters for them to safely fight. The laid back boy reveals [spoiler] that he was raised by the monsters, and known for being a very strong fighter amongst them. He had some sort of title? But he grabs a mask (I believe he used to wear one) off the floor, and changes into a stance/fighting style that he used to use. I think part of what made it notable was that it was bare handed fighting, but I can't say for sure. He declares that it's him (as in his old title among the monsters) and dares the monsters to fight him, either to cause a distraction or a cave-in, I don't remember which. [/spoiler] One of the older monsters steps forward and confirms this, and the monsters all charge to attack. I don't remember how the scene ends.

-- I think the cover had the girl and the laid back boy on it, maybe the stuck up one too, but I can't say for certain. I should know the art style if I see it.

--The manga may have been on hiatus at the time I read it, because I remember not being able to finish for some reason. However, that could have been the library not having it or the manga simply not being finished yet.

Fun fact that absolutely will not help with identification: this manga is where I learned the word lackadaisical.

Any suggestions as to what this might have been are welcome, it's driving me *crazy*. It's possible some details are different given that it's been quite a while since I read it.

manga,"I'm currently trying to remember the very first manga I ever read when I was younger. I remember the story itself was central around 3 or 4 girls who knew how to fight. The main villain of the series was extremely androgynous and considered attractive and never made an effort to establish their gender. The villain had a bedroom that had veiled curtains that was constantly filled with some kind of perfume or other airborne scent that seemed to keep people sleepy and hypnotized. The villain usually had clothing draped over them and bandages over their torso. I think that the villain had somehow hypnotized a love interest and a brother of some of the main characters that once discovered became a big conflict as they tried to snap them out of it while defeating the villain. I remember the girl that had the hypnotized older brother had a scene where she and her brother were sparring. She had a long staff and he had a short staff. She was confident she was going to win because she had the advantage of distance, but the brother quickly won. He said the qualities of a short but strong stick could be appreciated as much as the quality of the long staff. Both of those characters had black hair, and I believe both kept their hair short.

manga,"Read it years ago. The only thing I remember is that the MC returns to his kingdom that was taken over by someone/somthing to save his sister/friend or some other significant person. He is a mage and has chains covering his arms, and every time he uses his magic he loses some of his memory.

The reason for this thread's existence is the fact that both requests and suggestions became kind of stale. It's supposed to bring out more manga that is not RTed or recommended. Also, it's quite useful for the discussion of not so current titles.

Previous weeks: [First 72 weeks](http://www.reddit.com/r/manga/search?q=author%3Agladiatorua+What+manga+have+you+read+this+week%2C+and+what+do+you+think+about+it%3F&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all#page=1) and from [June 28, 2015 onwards](http://www.reddit.com/r/manga/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+What+manga+have+you+read+this+week%2C+and+what+do+you+think+about+it%3F&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all).

Also, not a rule or any kind of criticism, the more interesting part is not the list of the stuff you read, but your impressions of it.

The main one being Aot no requiem. But i didn't really like that either. Sure Eren does his plan and the people of paradi live happily ever after. But all his friends died as well which i don't like.

manga,"I don't use reddit much so sorry if I'm doing this wrong.

I'm looking for a manga where the Mc was a female protagonist, when she was a child she somehow saved the male lead and was scarred in the process, I think on her hand but I'm not sure. This made her ""damaged goods"" and hard for her to marry in high society. I think at this point because of the scar the male lead promises to marry her. When they grow up the male lead goes on an journey to defeat the demon king or something (this part I really remember but it's usually how they go) along with the hero and saintess (don't remember if she was a princess or not) but he dies in the journey. After a few years it's revealed he was still alive and returns. When he returns he's awarded something along the lines of court magician or something. Now with his new found title high society doesn't believe the female protagonist is worthy of him.

I am trying to identify a manga that I read a while ago, but can't find anymore. 

It was a manga of the Deathgame genre, were every player had dies IRL and was reincarnated in some kind of purgatory as a cute girl.

The host, who loved so be called an angel but was more like a demon, had everyone play games against each other and the lower would be killed off in the most gruesome way possible, all while being in the body of cute girls.

Who survives till the end makes it to the other side or got a wish, I don't really remember.

The MC soon identifies one of the participants as his sister and wants to protect her. The second ark teleported every surviving players to their high-school were they had to play a game of tag, but with some special rules: if too players who weren't it held hands, they couldn't be tagged and everyone who was it when he timer ran out would be killed. Playera had an allotment of points on their cellphones that could be used to do some special attacks or abilities, like teleports etc.

manga," I just finished Whole Cake Island and heard alot about the Reverie Arc. Some people say it is the best story based arc in One Piece

So should I watch the anime version of the arc or manga? People usually pick the manga version since the anime consist mainly of filler content but I am watching One Piece via One Pace. The Reverie arc in One Pace is just 3 episodes long as compared to 12 episodes in the original anime.

manga,"Medical manga is a pretty niche genre, and many of the ones out there aren't even that good, so I thought it would be a good idea to do I list recommendations for the ones that in my opinion are the best out there 

&amp;#x200B;

*-Medical Manhwa*

**medical return**  (definitely the best medical manhwa out there, this is  from the same  as Dr Elise, surprisingly the series goes way more  in-depth about its  medical aspects, maybe because it was a later story  by the author so he  had developed and also implemented more medicine in  the plot since it  was a common complaint in her first story, well even  if it's better it  still has it's a fair share of problems, a lot of the  drama feels fake  and some characters are one note, so it's definitely  not perfect, but  it's still a great read even with its flaws) 8/10

**Dr. Frost**  (a story about a psychologist that starts off cold and doing a  lot of  privacy breaches but turns into a better and more emotional  person as  he develops and goes about solving a lot of psychological  problems in  relatively episodic arcs about different psychological  cases, but that  at the off each season end up giving the characters a  lot of  development) 9/10

**The Legendary Beasts Animal Hospital** (not everybody likes it, and it also has its problems, but I have a soft spot for veterinarian manhwas since they are even rarer) 7/10

&amp;#x200B;

*-Medicine in an ""adventure"" context*

**Monster**  a classic anime, I am a med student and trust me when I say all  the  medical information on this is spot own (which isn't something I can   say for most medical stories lol, not the mention it's a fantastic   story in most aspect, the only problem about it is that it's a thriller   and only focus on medicine in selective parts of the story (it's still a   great story though) 9/10

**Black Jack**  (Tezuka was also a doctor, so the fact his medical manga is  good isn't  a surprise, and even if you are not into old manga there are  some  great recent spin-offs like young black jack) 8/10

&amp;#x200B;

*-Manga about medical specialties*

**Shrink: Dr. Yowai, a Psychiatrist**  (the research in this is top-notch and  the stories are really  emotional, I love how it does a great job of  teaching people about  mental health while also being an engaging story)  10/10

**Kounodori: Dr. Stork** (a good manga about a specific specialty, I don't think there is another manga about OBG/YN's out there, so this is good AND super unique) 8/10

**Radiation House** ( it has some cringy tropes, but overall it's a good and interesting manga about radiology) 7/10

**Iryuu: Team Medical Dragon** (a good manga about surgery) 7/10

**Give My Regards to Black Jack** (a serious and deep medical manga) 9/10

**Dr. Koto Shinryoujo**  (a chill manga about rural medicine, where After making a mistake in his work in Tokyo, a talented surgeon Goto Kensuke  is invited to take  charge of the only clinic on the small island of  Yonaguni, ) 8/10

**""The  Last Doctors Think of You Whenever They Look up to Cherry Blossoms""**  is also really good, it deals with deep topics like palliative care, and if euthanasia is ethically permissible, in an impartial and intelligent way, so far only 1 volume out of 3 has been translated, but it's still worth a read 9/10

&amp;#x200B;

*-Isekai medical manga*

**The Saint's Magic Power is Omnipotent** (not a lot of medicine most of the  time, but it is kinda chill) 6/10

**Parallel World Pharmacy**  (an isekai medical manga that is actually pretty  accurate and with aN  ethical MC, which is not a given in this genre, if the MC even asks their patients for consent for half of their procedures then you are in luck)  7/10

**Koudo ni Hattatsu shita Igaku wa Mahou to Kubetsu ga Tsukanai** (a more  ""realistic"" medical isekai, he has to use realistic procedures and the few medical tools he has with him to help people in a medical world) 8/10

**A Veterinarian in Another World**  ( a pretty average chill isekai medical  manga, but it's about a  veterinarian, and since that niche is even smaller it deserves mention  for being a bit more different) 6/10

**The Apothecary Diaries** is probably the only apothecary manga I have seen that focuses on the medical aspects of the synopsis, not only that but it also has great worldbuilding with interesting political situations from a unique Chines palace setting, if you liked book worm you will probably dig this too :) 7/10

manga,"On  October 24, 2022 , the  final chapter of Aliens area was published, but the English version of the final chapter's last page stated there is going to more stories in its final volume  tankobon which means one more story to wrap up loose plots so I bought Vol 3 to see the epilogue of the series, but instead these are  just bonus stories , because  as it turns out only vol 2 and 3 has  bonus stories  that focus on Hajime Sharaku

manga,"I was laying in bed and thinking about a Manga and it recalled another memory of another Manga where there is a male MC and he gets a female Elf follower. She was certainly a slave that turned follower

What I specifically was recalling was that the female elf was a princess and her brother is a prince. All elves have flat chests in this world but the princess that's the MC's follower is not flat but quite the opposite so much so that it drives the brother to wage war against the town or kingdom that MC is living in to get back his sister to have kids with her. Simply because she doesn't have a flat chest.

It gets so bad that someone who I think was the guild master decides to fight MC which makes it a very hard fight for MC but he does in the end win.

Some time later the princess, I think, goes on her own to not trouble the MC and turn herself in to her brother who places a slave crest on her or something which causes MC and brother to fight.

manga,"There was this manga(Or manwha/Manhua I'm not completely sure) that I read a couple of years ago on a comic/manga app that I downloaded from the playstore. Can't remember the app name.

Anyway from what I remember it's about some Blue skinned Alien/Elf girl who can connect to humans, other Aliens/Elves like her can too. In the beginning I think she connected to a cat &amp; it died so in turn her life was saved? When they are connected if the human dies the connection breaks &amp; if the Alien/Elf 'dies' the human would die in their place. 

She meets a guy while they're fighting for their lives? He knows she's an alien/Elf but he's fascinated instead of scared. He lets her stay at his house, I think he lived alone &amp; they become friends. 

Something...I don't remember happens &amp; he tries drowning her. They were connected so he was drowning instead &amp; he had to dive down to save her? Turns out he dislikes her &amp; was just faking, her race did something to his mom? Something huge happens &amp; they end up having to leave his house &amp; work together despite not liking each other.

I think the huge thing was someone of her race was torturing a kid at their home, some Alien/Elf woman. That or something in the street, news reporters, police, humans dying &amp; Aliens/Elves. 

The last bits I remember is that the guy gave her a name that had to do with a video game character or his mom, &amp; the Alien/Elf girl's skin turned white &amp; her hair became blonde.

manga,"It's been a few years since I read the manga so bear with me, the details may not be entirely accurate.

God transported the FL from her world (Japan) to the middle of a meadow in a fantasy world. She realizes that she now has a 'status window' and tries to use magic by shouting ""fireball!"" In turn, this creates a giant fireball. She wanders around and finds an empty cottage, then falls asleep in it.

 She wakes up to two knights in front of her (one of their names is Cyan, I think?) and they're questioning why she's sleeping in the cottage, because that cottage actually belongs to a dwarf they know of. She makes up something, and gives them a fake name of hers. They  all team up and go looking for the dwarf because he went missing a few days ago. They find him trapped under a rockfall, and she performs some fancy magic, frees him, and heals him.

Those two knights assign her to work at a doctors clinic, and I think she starts dreaming of this dude who turns out to be the Demon King, who's also the ML.

 Anyway, time passes, she makes friends with some demons (demons are friendly btw) and she also finds out that the Demon King has a crucial role within the world. He absorbs all the negative energy created by humans, and if he doesn't find his soulmate within his lifetime, he'll go berserk and destroy the world from madness, unless his advisers kill him beforehand. This cycle repeats over several thousand years. 

The FL is brought to the Demon King because he thinks that she might be his soulmate, but the only way to confirm that is if she tells him his true name from instinct. She does, they find out that they're soulmates, yada yada. She's brought back to the human kingdom, where she introduces him to her friends, and also tells everyone that she's from another world. 

Another kingdom kidnaps her, and the Demon King absolutely obliterates the kingdom. Also, the younger sister of one of his advisers is jealous of the FL, so she plots to kill her(?). 

Also, the Church tried to brainwash the FL into becoming one of them??? She took down the Pope, who could brainwash people, and saved a powerful kid who the Church possessed??

Side notes: 

A person's life span is dependent on how much mana/magic they have. The more mana = longer life span.

God met up with the FL and told her that when she dies in this world (after about 500 years or so), she'll return to her old world and live from the point she disappeared. So, it'll be as if time had never passed in her old world. And God took the form of someone she knew (I think the kid she saved from the Church) because his true form was too powerful for mortal eyes.

Hi,

So, me and a couple of people at the Italian YT channel AlchillTV have stumbled upon a list of 30+ interviews with Miura that have never been released/translated outside of Japan. These interviews can only be found in old Japanese magazines, and we've found some (but not in their entirety) that outline the story's continuation and reveal more about characters and magic/astral layers. I managed to purchase one of those old magazines, and this one in particular talks about the Idea of Evil, but we'll have to wait until March before we can have a full translation. Thanks to the twitter account (now inactive) nagare06, we got some pages of other interviews too. I want to share a couple of the things we discovered, and a video that goes more on detail is in the works. What we have discovered so far is:

1. Idea of Evil is canon and will reappear;
2. it can have different shapes;
3. there's an astral layer called ""the spectral world"" (we're still trying to translate the name properly) from which reality itself is created; above it there's god (not sure if he means the true god or Idea, a proper translation is in the works);
4. it was born because the monotheistic religion took over animism and the cult of nature (this plot should be explained by Mori and Studio Gaga later, and it's tied to Skull Knight's past);
5. beherits are pure souls that connect the physical world to the astral world, and the egg shape symbolizes that;
6. Casca will fully recover from her trauma;
7. the story will go through a ""Tao"" and ""Ki"" arc (Devilman is a proper example of what we should expect, maybe not in terms of the ending).

If you have any question, I'll be glad to answer them. Again, a video about what we found about Idea of Evil will (probably) be out this March on AlchillTV on YT.

Some clarifications: the account nagare06 also helped us with online research, and we were able to find some interviews on various Japanese websites (but only those that didn't get published in a magazine). Everything else will have to be purchased on AmazonJp and whatnot, and buying just this one old magazine from 2002 cost around 50$, so it's a money and time consuming effort. This is the umpteenth time that we find out how far behind the communities outside of the Japanese one are, but I think that in this case we can fix it thanks to what we have been able to discover. It will take quite some time, but we hope that what we want to do can help the community as a whole in undestanding Berserk and Miura's vision.

If you can help us spreading this message it would be very much appreciated.

manga,"The Manga (which I'm basically promoting on here) is Called ""Rebuild World""  
It follows the story of a Slum boy whose name is Akira. Before the story begins  it shows some panels that describes that He has led his entire life in betrayals backstabbing's and poor living conditions.  
However one day he stumbles upon an AI or an Artificial Intelligence who calls herself ""Alpha""  
This is where the story starts snowballing Akira's life.  
The few things to note about Akira is that he has a very cautious personality due to his time he spent in the slums so that makes him easily agitated.

So to start off on this world has a specific profession called Hunters whose job is to collect relics of the ""Old World""  
what is the Old World you ask?  
I forgot to mention this earlier but most of this world is a complete wasteland and this happened because of some sort of by my guess a scientific catastrophe that wiped out the people of before or the People of the Old World.  
The Old world was scientifically Leaps and leagues beyond what the current world technology can catch upto and the scientists of the current world are buying up every Rare Old World Tech they can get they're hands on.  
This is Where Hunters come in They're Job can range from monster exterminations to surveys to Bodyguarding but the Main Money comes from relics which are Found in the Old World Ruins...  
Akira our main character is Hired by Alpha to become a Hunter who she will personally train to reach an Old World Ruin and Until Akira Reaches that specific Old world Ruin he will Have full support of Alpha The AI  


Welllll....That's bout All I wanna say if this manga/Light Novel even slightly interests you I would love it if you read it  
sidenote: I'm Mainly a Light Novel reader and I saw The manga seems to be heading in a different direction from the light novel which might result in a completely different story from the Light novel

The male lead accepts, and they go on an adventure.

“Sometime later in the story, he meets this nobleman who I think turns out to be a prince.  The prince tries to force the male lead to give him the girl, and this leads to a battle.

1. As I said, I love SSR. The contrast of the moe art style and relaxed pace almost SOL style storytelling with the grim post-apocalyptic backdrop, and the way Tsukumizu manages to weave in deep and philosophical themes without ever getting preachy... But it's mostly the tone... if you know you know. If there's more stuff like this out there, then I want to read it.

2. I like serious stories. Some comedy is great - much better than none at all. But it should be in contrast to - and not overwhelm - the serious side. Likewise, I prefer some romance over none.

3. That's not to say I don't like romance as a main focus. But I usually prefer there to be something extra that spices it up. Such a weird setting, yuri, or some supernatural element. Also, controversial / ""problematic"" romances are cool with me. I like the spice.

4. I like cute girls. Moe art-styles. Especially that really exaggerated huge-eyed 2000s style.

5. I like subtle, slow-paced, understated storytelling. Male power fantasy wall-to-wall action scenes bore me.

6. On the subject of controversial content, don't be afraid to recommend stuff with high amounts of violence or sex. One thing I can't stand though is giant boobs.

I want to say the name went something like ""Kata.."" or ""Kara..."" but I can't seem find anything matching it.  


I remember It is about a modern society that has created man sized remote controlled robots. They control the robots by transferring their souls inside them. The MC (Who looks kinda like Ichigo) is also part of some special force that hunts down rouge robots with his female Partner. Unlike other pilots he kinda is a sentient robot thing himself and as a result, he doesn't need to transfer his soul.   
I think it also invovled about him finding out about his origins or trying to find his place in human society as well? Honestly I can't really remember and want to reread it again.   


It also had a really cool, edgy artstyle, very monotone using black and white for the covers too if I'm not mistaken.

manga,"Finished the manga and the spinoff one named 21st century boys. I really liked the series but the ending of the show kind of ruined my overall experience because you felt the series was leading towards some incredible reveal but that never came. Breaking down more of my thoughts below. One of them is a general rant of my unfiltered thoughts right after I finished the last chapter and the other part are some questions I have about the show. Not trying to come off as too critical its just that I heard this was considered one of the best manga's of all time and I enjoyed monster. So, if anyone wants to explain to me some of the questions I have that would be great.  

Did anyone think the story took a nose dive in the last 1/3rd of the manga. After Friend saved the pope and the last time skip happened. I felt that the story kind of introduced to many plot details and even the ending didn't really explain a lot about how friend came back three times, how does kanna have esp, and how it cuts off important pieces of information and does a final reveal that wasn't very good. The ending in this sort of story matters a lot because its  been building up to one big thing for several years. I thought the plot got really cartoony in the end something out of a south park episode. Friend was so mad at them for Neglecting him that he became a cult leader and reenacted their childhood? Like it doesn't even show you how he does it. The people he manipulates are complete dumbasses they betray their entire family for some guy who reads fortune cookie advice. You dont really get a good sense of his motivation like Johan in monster, just really dumb how he held onto a grudge for this long???? Like dude Johan was tortured and neglected by his mom. You were just left out of a game so you became a cult leader and killed most of the worlds population and had a kid with Kenjis sister for whatever reason. Also the plot to go the mars was really dumb.

&amp;#x200B;

sorry if I am ranting its just the first 2/3rds were so good but the overall score is ruined when all that build up goes nowhere. Like kenji and the love of his life don't really had good moments together when he comes back. And how Kenji is kind of a dick to Kanna was he also comes back. Below are some other questions I have about the manga.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

1, does friend have a different voice 20th century boy. Like can know one tell he sounds like Fukubei ?

2. How does foresight work. Kana and God both have it but than they dont have it? Does Kana's dad even have it. I thought only the fake friend was the only one who had real powers the original used tricks? Or can it be like in the perfect edition where Fukubei was friend the whole time?

3. How does friend survive from falling off the building and getting choked out as a kid?

4. And how does that virtual reality room work. Its connected to the real world too?

5. Does no one else in the word find friend suspicions. A mysterious masked figure who creates vaccanies for viruses as soon as they come out? Even in our world people have a lot of disdain and distrust of misqutoast politicans like Biden and Fauci? Friend created a not so subtle police state and no one rose up?

6. Friends whole plan is something Cartman would do, how much of a grudge does he have . He got kenjis sister pregnant for no reason? Why did he even do that? Just to get back at him. I am not seeing this brilliantly written antangonist anywhere.

7. What happened with Kana and the gang members. Did they take a fake vaccine so that she could take the real one because they wanted her to live?

Breaking down more of my thought below. One of them be a general rant of my unfiltered thought right after I finish the last chapter and the other part be some question I have about the show. Not try to come off as too critical its just that I hear this be consider one of the best manga's of all time and I enjoy monster. So, if anyone want to explain to me some of the question I have that would be great.  

Did anyone think the story take a nose dive in the last 1/3rd of the manga. After Friend save the pope and the last time skip happened. I felt that the story kind of introduce to many plot detail and even the end didn't really explain a lot about how friend come back three times, how do kanna have esp, and how it cut off important piece of information and do a final reveal that wasn't very good. The end in this sort of story matter a lot because its  be build up to one big thing for several years. I think the plot get really cartoony in the end something out of a south park episode. Friend be so mad at them for Neglecting him that he become a cult leader and reenact their childhood? Like it doesn't even show you how he do it. The people he manipulate be complete dumbass they betray their entire family for some guy who read fortune cookie advice. You dont really get a good sense of his motivation like Johan in monster, just really dumb how he hold onto a grudge for this long???? Like dude Johan be torture and neglect by his mom. You be just leave out of a game so you become a cult leader and kill most of the world population and have a kid with Kenjis sister for whatever reason. Also the plot to go the mar be really dumb.

&amp;#x200B;

sorry if I be rant its just the first 2/3rds be so good but the overall score be ruin when all that build up go nowhere. Like kenji and the love of his life don't really have good moment together when he come back. And how Kenji be kind of a dick to Kanna be he also come back. Below be some other question I have about the manga.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

1, do friend have a different voice 20th century boy. Like can know one tell he sound like Fukubei ?

2. How do foresight work. Kana and God both have it but than they dont have it? Does Kana's dad even have it. I think only the fake friend be the only one who have real power the original used tricks? Or can it be like in the perfect edition where Fukubei be friend the whole time?

3. How do friend survive from fall off the building and get choke out as a kid?

4. And how do that virtual reality room work. Its connect to the real world too?

5. Does no one else in the word find friend suspicions. A mysterious masked figure who create vaccanies for virus as soon as they come out? Even in our world people have a lot of disdain and distrust of misqutoast politicans like Biden and Fauci? Friend create a not so subtle police state and no one rise up?

6. Friends whole plan be something Cartman would do, how much of a grudge do he have . He get kenjis sister pregnant for no reason? Why do he even do that? Just to get back at him. I be not see this brilliantly write antangonist anywhere.

7. What happen with Kana and the gang members. Did they take a fake vaccine so that she could take the real one because they want her to live?

If anyone can answer any of these question I would appreciate it.",overall review thought 20th century boys spoilers ahead finished manga spinoff one name 21st century boys really like series end show kind ruined overall experience felt series lead towards incredible reveal never came breaking thought one general rant unfiltered thought right finish last chapter part question show try come critical hear consider one best manga time enjoy monster anyone want explain question would great anyone think story take nose dive last 1 3rd manga friend save pope last time skip happened felt story kind introduce many plot detail even end really explain lot friend come back three times kanna esp cut important piece information final reveal good end sort story matter lot build one big thing several years think plot get really cartoony end something south park episode friend mad neglecting become cult leader reenact childhood like even show people manipulate complete dumbass betray entire family guy read fortune cookie advice dont really get good sense motivation like johan monster really dumb hold onto grudge long like dude johan torture neglect mom leave game become cult leader kill world population kid kenjis sister whatever reason also plot go mar really dumb amp x200b sorry rant first 2 3rds good overall score ruin build go nowhere like kenji love life really good moment together come back kenji kind dick kanna also come back question manga amp x200b amp x200b 1 friend different voice 20th century boy like know one tell sound like fukubei 2 foresight work kana god dont kana dad even think fake friend one real power original used tricks like perfect edition fukubei friend whole time 3 friend survive fall building get choke kid 4 virtual reality room work connect real world 5 one else word find friend suspicions mysterious masked figure create vaccanies virus soon come even world people lot disdain distrust misqutoast politicans like biden fauci friend create subtle police state one rise 6 friends whole plan something cartman would much grudge get kenjis sister pregnant reason even get back see brilliantly write antangonist anywhere 7 happen kana gang members take fake vaccine could take real one want live anyone answer question would appreciate

manga,"MangaDex still has lost its feed system after the last data breach the newest version rolled, and no substitute or similar implementation has rolled out yet. As such, after losing my patience after missing new chapters so many times in a row, I made this program with Python. You can get it at https://github.com/Tosh0kan/FeeDex.

Be mindful that this is still in beta. I tested it enough to make sure it works, but I haven't done extensive bug hunting, so don't be surprised when the program crashes.

##FAQ

Q: Do I need Python to use it?

A: No. The program is open source, and is licensed under GPL-3, so if you want to get the source code and use like that you can, but you don't need it. Just grab the latest version's zip [on the releases page](https://github.com/Tosh0kan/FeeDex/releases) and use the executables inside it.

#

Q: How does it work

A: For proper instructions, read the main page of the repository; it has a pretty comprehensive use guide, but the gist it, you will use one of the executables to subscribe to the mangas you want by pasting in the url of the main page of the manga. Then you will use the other that will ping the MangaDex API looking for updates every 15 minutes, and if it detects any new chapter, it will throw a toaster notification, and the notification will remain in Windows Notification Center.

#

Q: If stuff breaks, what do I do.

A: When the program crashes, it will throw an error window.

manga,"Classic time regression he goes back to when he was a kid (I've read so many of these that the plot sometimes starts to mix together so please forgive me if some of the description is from a separate manhwa)

Plot: Manhwa starts of showing how OP he is, he killed a ton of people. a young soldier goes up to him for revenge for killing his father. MC does not want to kill children and tired of living, kills himself. He regresses back to his young self (forgot the age, mid-teens i think) in time to get bullied by his older brother who he beats up. Knights standing by all go to beat him up and i think he beat them up? The world has circles of mana instead of realms/tiers. he wants to prevent his older sister who is really smart from getting married of to a corrupted family. The mother of his older brother now hates him for beating up her son. The MC goes to school and tasks his op butler with protecting his sister. He is ambushed by the people sending him to school who were hired by his stepmother and he uses a high-grade potion to recover since beating them up weakened him. His butler uses clones or something to help him without people realizing and he is able to get to the academy on foot. 

at some point in the story it goes on about how the family his sister married to treated her really badly and she had to beg them not to kill him in his past life when he was young.

thats pretty much all i remember and im not even sure if its all accurate....

please help!

manga,"Hello,

I've been reading manga for about my whole life. Mainly trending shonens and some seinens. I'm not an expert by far in this field. 

While reading them I've noticed that the page layout is often quite simple. Sometimes you can have a full double page illustration (Berserk and One Punch Man do that well) or big cases but nothing too crazy. In comics tho it happens a lot to read some pages that blew my mind.

manga,"I would like to find this manga. It was around chap 15 1 year ago.

The MC isekai-ed to a forest in a fantasy world. The forest was known as a grand forest with a lot of strong monsters.

The forest was affected by a curse (or poison, I don't clearly remember) which gradually weakens the monsters there. The one making that curse is a kingdom right next to the forest. The king wanted to merge the forest into his territory, but the monsters were too strong so he decided to use the curse to weaken them. The price for that curse was a lot of life. The king was extremely discriminate against non-human beings so he enslaved a lot of demi humans (mostly beast mans) and used them as sacrifices to produce the curse.

Am I ask too much when I request that it currently be under 70 chapter so I don't get overwhelmed? If not, what would be reasonable?

I'd also love to read some stuff that's complete and under 50 chapters, and I'd especially love if you can recommend some stuff that's either a one-shot, or a few chapter but really make the most of their time.

I really thrive on compel character and really intense action scenes.

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Nijiiro Days (Finished)**  
If you like slice of life, romance and school life manga I definitely recommend this one. Its a good mix of comedy and romance but not to the extent that it gets cringe. The protagonists are enjoyable and for me was very memorable. The romance part takes part over the whole manga but isnt sluggish because other things happen that works well. It covers the fun parts of high school but also the difficulties that comes when you grow up. Other than that its a very grounded manga that isnt flashy at all. Definitely a 9/10 for me.   

2. **Kaoru hana Wa Rin To Saku (Ongoing)**  
In a way this one is very similar to Nijiiro Days as it follows 4 male protagonists who then makes friends with two girls, which then escalates in to the ""main main"" protagonist and the main girl fall in love. Where it does differ is how the protagonist male charachters and the girls meet. Other than that its a romance, comedy, slice of life, school life manga that is also grounded. This one covers the difficulties of life and how standing out brings lots of problems. A very cute and fun manga. Its a 8/10  

3. **Tondemo Skill de Isekai Hourou Meshi**  
I really like this manga, its a 100% comedy. It follows Mukouda, who as you probably read in the title, got isekai'd into a magical world. It begins as other isekais where  Mukouda is summoned as a chosen Hero but hes summoned wrongly and has no offensive skills. His only skill is a skill called online market which helps him make food, which he then uses to make his way through the world. Oh yeah he also makes friend with a giant fenrir wolf who is the best boy. 8/10  

4. **Kengan Ashura (Finished) + Omega (Ongoing)**  
If you like fighting manga I recommend if you like more grounded fighting. Its a pure fighting manga that has comedy and some fan service here and there. While this manga has some ""magic"" martial arts that defies common sense alot of the fighting styles and named moves tries to have some realistic explanation behind them. Its not over the top like Baki where its fighting to the point of very unrealistic but not as realistic as Rikudou (which isnt 100% realistic). Other than that its a very enjoyable manga to read. Kengan Ashura is where the story starts and while the artwork starts of kinda whacky it gets very good later on. For me Ashura, the first manga, is a 10/10 ngl and Omega right now is 7/10  

5. **Sakamoto Days (Ongoing)**  
One of the newer manga on the list but never the less a very very good manga. It follows Sakamoto who is a retired assassin who was the best of his job. But he quit when he fell in love. Now hes out of shape and runs a grocery store. This manga has the chance to become one of the absolute best action mangas ive read, no cap. It has a good amount of action and comedy. The characters are memorable and the artstyle is dope. All the fighting scenes are very good and the creativity here is actually over the top. It is ""magical fighting"" where some fighting doesnt make sense like they punch people through multiple walls but this never bothered me because it does it very well. 10/10 right now  

6. **Golden Kamui (Finished)**  
This i think might be the most meta manga on the list, other than nr.5 but I think it deserves the spot. It plays out during the 1900s after the Japanese-Russo War and follows Sugimoto The Immortal and an Ainu named Aspira aswell as a varied cast of memorable characters. This manga while having some unrealistic things in it, it is very grounded and realistic. It deals with the struggles of native/aboriginal people and the ever expanding modernisation threatening to push the natives out of their homes. Its comedy is a bit niche but I loved it alot. Its without doubt one of my favorites. The first 150 chapters are just so comfy and enjoyable to read. Its a 9/10  

7. **Sekaioni (Finished)**  
Alice in the mirror syndrome, a rare disease that only a few select people have which makes them able to go the the mirror world. Here they have to fight World devils who threaten the reality of the world. This manga is in a way hard to recommend because while it looks cool you realize fast that its a gruesome and horrible manga. It deals with pedophilia, loss of family members, horrible family conditions and alot more. While its good I can understand that not everyone will like this, not only for the plot and what happens to the main character in the beginning and through the series but also the art style. I like this manga because how sad it is but also what it deals with. 7/10  

8. **Kamisama no lutoori ni, 0 -zero- and Kamisama no lutoori (All Finished)**  
When I read Kamisama no lutoori I was actually surprised on how good it was. It follows Shun and his journey when hes chosen as a participant of a death game made by a selfproclaimed god. Its a supernatural manga which uses classical japanese games and traditions for its inspiration. Its a good manga and its a recommendation for sure. Kamisama no lutoori ni is the sequel and follows another protagonists who go through more or less the same thing but its very more fleshed out and its different games. This sequel is much better than the already good first one and the ending is dope. Very good. ""0-zero"" is the prequel to both of the manga and while its not anything special it gives some good backstory so read it. All in all 8/10   

9. **Blame (Finished)**  
This is my all time favorite manga and I can tell you now its a 10/10 for me. Its made by the genious Tsutomu Nihei who also made ""Knights of sidonia"" and ""Biomega"" who are both very good manga. Blame is a futuristic manga that holds secrets close to its heart. There are very little dialouge and the eviroment and art speaks for the manga. There is just so much mystery and things in this manga that you just want to know but never will because thats the charm of the story. The megastructure and general eviroment is just so... gigantic and unfathomable. You dont need to know everything. While I personaly love the art I can understand if people dont because it can get very cluttered and hard to follow. However its still worth reading. 10/10  

10. **Grand Blue**  
I lied this might be the most ""meta"" manga. I think a lot of people know this one. I just got to say that I love this manga. The comedy and unexpected seriousness that comes out sometimes just completes this. While there are a alot of fan service like ass and tiddies I dont actually mind it this time around because I dont think it takes away from the story like ""the 7 deadly sins"". Love the comedy and the art and faces the characters make. 9/10

**Yofukashi no uta:** A very cute and enjoyable manga about a the freedom of the night. Its lighthearted and funny but get serious some times. It holds the concept of bonds between people close. Its a good manga and a worthy read.   


**Juujika no Rokunin:** Eh this manga is gruesome.  However I really like it. Its about the revenge on bullies by the bullied but cranked to eleven. Its gore galore in a way thats pretty creative and you really  get to hate the bullies because god are they awful. That isnt to say that the protagonist is very good either. Hes interesting and you get why he does what he does and why he is like he is but jesus its overkill. Its a bit slow but give it a go. 

  


**Dont read this**  


**Domestic na Kanjo:** Please dont read this, its just incest on incest on horrible romance.

1. **Nijiiro Days (Finished)**  
If you like slice of life, romance and school life manga I definitely recommend this one. Its a good mix of comedy and romance but not to the extent that it get cringe. The protagonist be enjoyable and for me be very memorable. The romance part take part over the whole manga but isnt sluggish because other thing happen that work well. It cover the fun part of high school but also the difficulty that come when you grow up. Other than that its a very grounded manga that isnt flashy at all. Definitely a 9/10 for me.   

2. **Kaoru hana Wa Rin To Saku (Ongoing)**  
In a way this one be very similar to Nijiiro Days as it follow 4 male protagonist who then make friend with two girls, which then escalate in to the ""main main"" protagonist and the main girl fall in love. Where it do differ be how the protagonist male charachters and the girl meet. Other than that its a romance, comedy, slice of life, school life manga that be also grounded. This one cover the difficulty of life and how stand out brings lot of problems. A very cute and fun manga. Its a 8/10  

3. **Tondemo Skill de Isekai Hourou Meshi**  
I really like this manga, its a 100% comedy. It follow Mukouda, who as you probably read in the title, get isekai'd into a magical world. It begin as other isekais where  Mukouda be summon as a chosen Hero but he summon wrongly and have no offensive skills. His only skill be a skill call online market which help him make food, which he then use to make his way through the world. Oh yeah he also make friend with a giant fenrir wolf who be the best boy. 8/10  

4. **Kengan Ashura (Finished) + Omega (Ongoing)**  
If you like fight manga I recommend if you like more grounded fighting. Its a pure fight manga that have comedy and some fan service here and there. While this manga have some ""magic"" martial art that defies common sense alot of the fighting style and name move try to have some realistic explanation behind them. Its not over the top like Baki where its fighting to the point of very unrealistic but not as realistic as Rikudou (which isnt 100% realistic). Other than that its a very enjoyable manga to read. Kengan Ashura be where the story start and while the artwork start of kinda whacky it get very good later on. For me Ashura, the first manga, be a 10/10 ngl and Omega right now be 7/10  

5. **Sakamoto Days (Ongoing)**  
One of the new manga on the list but never the less a very very good manga. It follow Sakamoto who be a retired assassin who be the best of his job. But he quit when he fell in love. Now hes out of shape and run a grocery store. This manga have the chance to become one of the absolute best action mangas ive read, no cap. It have a good amount of action and comedy. The character be memorable and the artstyle be dope. All the fighting scene be very good and the creativity here be actually over the top. It be ""magical fighting"" where some fighting doesnt make sense like they punch people through multiple wall but this never bother me because it do it very well. 10/10 right now  

6. **Golden Kamui (Finished)**  
This i think might be the most meta manga on the list, other than nr.5 but I think it deserve the spot. It play out during the 1900s after the Japanese-Russo War and follow Sugimoto The Immortal and an Ainu name Aspira aswell as a varied cast of memorable characters. This manga while have some unrealistic thing in it, it be very grounded and realistic. It deal with the struggle of native/aboriginal people and the ever expand modernisation threaten to push the native out of their homes. Its comedy be a bit niche but I love it alot. Its without doubt one of my favorites. The first 150 chapter be just so comfy and enjoyable to read. Its a 9/10  

7. **Sekaioni (Finished)**  
Alice in the mirror syndrome, a rare disease that only a few select people have which make them able to go the the mirror world. Here they have to fight World devil who threaten the reality of the world. This manga be in a way hard to recommend because while it look cool you realize fast that its a gruesome and horrible manga. It deal with pedophilia, loss of family members, horrible family condition and alot more. While its good I can understand that not everyone will like this, not only for the plot and what happen to the main character in the beginning and through the series but also the art style. I like this manga because how sad it be but also what it deal with. 7/10  

8. **Kamisama no lutoori ni, 0 -zero- and Kamisama no lutoori (All Finished)**  
When I read Kamisama no lutoori I be actually surprise on how good it was. It follow Shun and his journey when he choose as a participant of a death game make by a selfproclaimed god. Its a supernatural manga which use classical japanese game and tradition for its inspiration. Its a good manga and its a recommendation for sure. Kamisama no lutoori ni be the sequel and follow another protagonist who go through more or less the same thing but its very more flesh out and its different games. This sequel be much good than the already good first one and the end be dope. Very good. ""0-zero"" be the prequel to both of the manga and while its not anything special it give some good backstory so read it. All in all 8/10   

9. **Blame (Finished)**  
This be my all time favorite manga and I can tell you now its a 10/10 for me. Its make by the genious Tsutomu Nihei who also make ""Knights of sidonia"" and ""Biomega"" who be both very good manga. Blame be a futuristic manga that hold secret close to its heart. There be very little dialouge and the eviroment and art speaks for the manga. There be just so much mystery and thing in this manga that you just want to know but never will because thats the charm of the story. The megastructure and general eviroment be just so... gigantic and unfathomable. You dont need to know everything. While I personaly love the art I can understand if people dont because it can get very cluttered and hard to follow. However its still worth reading. 10/10  

10. **Grand Blue**  
I lie this might be the most ""meta"" manga. I think a lot of people know this one. I just get to say that I love this manga. The comedy and unexpected seriousness that come out sometimes just complete this. While there be a alot of fan service like as and tiddies I dont actually mind it this time around because I dont think it take away from the story like ""the 7 deadly sins"". Love the comedy and the art and face the character make. 9/10  


Honorable Mentions:

**Yofukashi no uta:** A very cute and enjoyable manga about a the freedom of the night. Its lighthearted and funny but get serious some times. It hold the concept of bond between people close. Its a good manga and a worthy read.   


**Juujika no Rokunin:** Eh this manga be gruesome.  However I really like it. Its about the revenge on bully by the bully but crank to eleven. Its gore galore in a way thats pretty creative and you really  get to hate the bully because god be they awful. That isnt to say that the protagonist be very good either. Hes interesting and you get why he do what he do and why he be like he be but jesus its overkill. Its a bit slow but give it a go. 

  


**Dont read this**  


**Domestic na Kanjo:** Please dont read this, its just incest on incest on horrible romance.

  
**Rent a girlfriend:** Dont read this. The romance suck and the main character its pitful and boring

  
**Shounen No Abyss:** Yeah this be in honorable mention but while I do like the manga, if you be bad with sucide, depression, gaslighting, manipulation and such dont read this. This manga be like a giant depression honestly. While I like the manga I dont know if I can recommend this lol. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Dead tube**: Its  Just a big no. Gore, nudity and a non existant story.

manga,"So, I first read 'A girl on the shore' manga and really liked it. And I wanted more similar manga as this one to read. And I found them. I then read, a really popular series, ' The flowers of evil'. I'm pretty sure many of you guys must've heard about it. I really liked that too. It was a great one. But I wanted more like that to read. So, I started reading 'Inside Mari'. The same author who was the writer of ' The flowers of evil'. I didn't expect much from it, but it surpassed my expectations. The end was a bit unsatisfying. But it was a great series overall. I just binged all these series in two days. They were too short.

So, you get the idea what type of series I'm looking for. I'll be glad if you find the manga with somewhat similar romance as the manga I mentioned above has. I don't just want a normal romance series. I want a romance series which also includes suspense/mysteries or psychological things as these series include.

# My synopsis

&gt;*In this world, certain people may encounter a black Torii arch that leads to a small secret shrine. Here, one can meet a mysterious lady dressed like a priestess, and those who do have the opportunity to have a wish granted.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*However, they're told upfront there're 2 major conditions they must abide by: first, wishes can only be granted if they provide something of equal value. The more precious/valuable an item is to the person, the greater its value for wish-making; second, whatever they wish for will be invalidated upon their passing from the world.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*What follows are the wishes of those who crossed paths with Anten-sama, and where they lead...*

&amp;#x200B;

*Anten-sama* is a Shonen Jump Plus series that began publishing from January 2022 to February 2023 and has been the subject of much discussion. Every newly published chapter had garnered over 200 comments within 7 days, a feat that is actually very difficult to accomplish on the website that only a selection of serialised works are capable of.

Because you see, as per my synopsis, the story operates as a series of vignettes, in a manner kind of like *Goosebumps* or *Are You Afraid of the Dark?* (without the campfire). The premise of *Anten-sama* is simple, but author Yosugi Itsuki is an absolute genius who wields it in surprisingly flexible, creative and captivating fashion.

I don't want to spoil any of the stories, but they vary in tone: from the expected horror and monkey's paw to the soft and wholesome. It sounds counter-intuitive, but they are all engaging and thought-provoking and done well.

\---

*Anten-sama* has been serialising on a fortnightly schedule after the first 3 chapters, and while this slowed pacing has been cleverly utilised to make the tales even more engaging, I'd also assess it as a factor for why it hadn't caught on with readers outside of Japan (alongside the wordy nature of it). At least it still got 16th Place in the Web category for the 2022 NEXT! Manga Awards.

Every newly publish chapter have garner over 200 comment within 7 days, a feat that be actually very difficult to accomplish on the website that only a selection of serialise work be capable of.

Because you see, as per my synopsis, the story operate as a series of vignettes, in a manner kind of like *Goosebumps* or *Are You Afraid of the Dark?* (without the campfire). The premise of *Anten-sama* be simple, but author Yosugi Itsuki be an absolute genius who wield it in surprisingly flexible, creative and captivate fashion.

I don't want to spoil any of the stories, but they vary in tone: from the expect horror and monkey's paw to the soft and wholesome. It sound counter-intuitive, but they be all engaging and thought-provoking and do well.

\---

*Anten-sama* have be serialise on a fortnightly schedule after the first 3 chapters, and while this slow pacing have be cleverly utilised to make the tale even more engaging, I'd also assess it as a factor for why it hadn't catch on with reader outside of Japan (alongside the wordy nature of it). At least it still get 16th Place in the Web category for the 2022 NEXT! Manga Awards.

manga,"I forgot the title but it was a fun read.

MC is the dragon itself

The dragon was a fearsome character that the world feared and he was greedy for treasure.

He had a huge load of treasure and one day slept in for way too long not sure if it was hundreds or thousands of years.

While sleeping his nest got robbed and turned into a goblin nest and a dragon who looks similar to him got killed. The world thought they killed him.

When he woke up he was upset for being robbed.
Some adventurers came in to kill goblins(not sure if I remember it right) but ran  away or got killed. 

Last guy standing is an isekaied character who the dragon asked for a current era recap. 

While listening to the explanation the dragon got a status notification. 

He got LV1. Apparently in this world nonhumans can't lv up or get skills if they don't know or understand that exp status and skills exist.

He has a skill to detect Italic speech in text bubbles.
He also decided to become an adventurer by crashing into town with isekai guy.


TL:DR

Characters

MC= Dragon( loves treasure, world thinks he's dead, Dragons can't transform )

Sidekick= Isekaied adventurer 

Setting

Monsters can't level up or get skills if they don't know about it.

Dragon MC overslept in his treasure nest. Wakes up in the future robbed and his place turned into goblin nest.

Sidekick guy is a normie but gets carried by MC but towns are very wary of huge MC crashing into town all the time.


MC skills
Italic sensors in speech bubbles( he brings it up a lot)

manga,"I've never been a huge fan of reading manga, but then I watched *More than a married couple, but not lovers* and instantly had to go read the manga for it. Amusingly, that anime/manga is WAY outside of what I normally watch, but it pulled me in. I'm caught up on MTMC and have since then read GE: Good Ending, Domestic Girlfriend and Suzuka as apparently that's the type of manga I enjoy.

I thought about reading Fuuka as I just finished Suzuka, but I really don't want to put myself through that twist (I already know what happens).

What would be a good recommendation, following the themes of what I've been reading, for something new to read? I'd prefer something that's complete and doesn't have a dumpster fire ending. I'd also prefer something Seinen over Shonen. No Hentai, but I'm perfectly fine with Ecchi.

The story happens in a school, and the characters are teenagers. In the original ending of the story, her character died cause she did something to the FL of her favorite's story. So, to avoid that, she acts like a good person and break her engagement with the prince (I think it was a prince) and wants to see the love between the ML and the FL of the original story. But the ML fall in love with the protagonist. If I remember correctly, the antagonist was a girl with short red hair and was from a family that used to be rich but lost all their money in gambling (could be wrong about how they lost it, but she was bullied because she was a noblewoman and now she's poor). In a scene the protagonist gives her a dress to go to the ball where (according to the novel) she is supposed to fall in love with the ML. The protagonist's family were florists. In the end, the antagonist ends up with a professor of her school after a time skip. I think the ML was blonde and the protagonist too, but could be wrong cause I read a lot of manwha and maybe I'm thinking about other characters, lol I remember a lot of details but not the name, help :(

She was top of her class and the antagonist was jealous about it. In the original novel, the girl with red hair was top of her class. Also, in a scene the protagonist make flower arrangements for the ball, and everyone is amazed at how beautiful the decorations were. There is a professor/headmaster of the school that hates the protagonist and is trying to help the antagonist bc she couldn't tolerate the idea of someone that isn't from noble blood to get married to the prince, or something like that (the protagonist wasn't from a noble family I think, she was rich bc her family business was a success iirc)

manga,"Hello there! 
I don't know if someone could help me, but let's try.

I read a lot of manga and it would be difficult to write all of them (lol). I like a lot of genres.
I read basically everything of Asano, Taniguchi, Urasawa, Yamamoto. I loved Oyasumi PunPun, A journal of my father, Ichi The killer, Devilman.
Obviously I read the classic shonen: hunter x hunter is awesome every time I read it.
I also love spokon: I reread in these days Slam Dunk and Haikyu.

manga,"There are Chainsaw Man spoilers but they're all in spoiler tags. I enjoy anime a lot but I can't seem to enjoy manga. Fight scenes don't feel as epic. Emotional scenes don't feel as sad. I'm on chapter 69 of Chainsaw Man and &gt;!Quanxi hugging her fiend girlfriend!&lt; didn't make me feel anything.

manga,"These days I find it very hard to get into a lot of fantasy manga because they are far too derivative of video games for my tastes. This is often because such a high percentage of fantasy manga now are long-named isekai where the protagonist is *explicitly* transported into a video game, but the tropes and markers have even started trickling into fantasies that aren't explicitly video game-based. Here's a couple of examples to demonstrate what I mean:

* Characters explicitly refer to video game mechanics such as levels, gaining skills (""I need to learn how to use a sword"" vs ""I need to acquire the 'sword' skill"", by example), and experience.
* The existence of generic world features and organizations generally associated with video games such as an adventurers guild, dungeons, and a demon king.
* For isekai, the protagonist is often deeply genre/trope aware and seems like they'd been planning for this to happen to them their whole life.

I'm really interested in fantasy settings that steer away from these conventions and have more original, fleshed-out settings. It's definitely fine for them to be *inspired* by mythological and cultural aspects of our world, almost all fantasy is, and it's not even a problem if they're still an isekai as long as they don't have any of the things I mention above (This used to be more of a rule with isekai, in fact).

Here's some pretty good examples of works that exemplify what I mean. Some might not be manga original or even have a manga, but I think it helps illustrate the recommendations i'm seeking:

* Akatsuki no Yona
* Berserk
* Escaflowne
* Fushigi Yuugi
* Mushoku Tensei (arguable, but the world is really well-built and vibrant)
* Record of Lodoss War
* Twelve Kingdoms
* Seirei no Moribito
* Spice and Wolf
* To Your Eternity
* Slayers

I tried to capture a pretty wide net of genres, I'm fine with anything whether it's shounen/shoujo/seinen or comedy/drama/romance as long it feels like a lived-in world that doesn't take me out of narrative with video game mechanics and genre-savvy fourth wall characters.

These day I find it very hard to get into a lot of fantasy manga because they be far too derivative of video game for my tastes. This be often because such a high percentage of fantasy manga now be long-named isekai where the protagonist be *explicitly* transport into a video game, but the trope and marker have even start trickle into fantasy that aren't explicitly video game-based. Here's a couple of example to demonstrate what I mean:

* Characters explicitly refer to video game mechanic such as levels, gain skill (""I need to learn how to use a sword"" v ""I need to acquire the 'sword' skill"", by example), and experience.
* The existence of generic world feature and organization generally associate with video game such as an adventurer guild, dungeons, and a demon king.
* For isekai, the protagonist be often deeply genre/trope aware and seem like they'd be plan for this to happen to them their whole life.

I'm really interested in fantasy setting that steer away from these convention and have more original, fleshed-out settings. It's definitely fine for them to be *inspired* by mythological and cultural aspect of our world, almost all fantasy is, and it's not even a problem if they're still an isekai as long as they don't have any of the thing I mention above (This use to be more of a rule with isekai, in fact).

Here's some pretty good example of work that exemplify what I mean. Some might not be manga original or even have a manga, but I think it help illustrate the recommendation i'm seeking:

* Akatsuki no Yona
* Berserk
* Escaflowne
* Fushigi Yuugi
* Mushoku Tensei (arguable, but the world be really well-built and vibrant)
* Record of Lodoss War
* Twelve Kingdoms
* Seirei no Moribito
* Spice and Wolf
* To Your Eternity
* Slayers

3 - the mc is a hero, who managed to defeat the demon king, (pretty sure he had the power of creation or something similiar), on the way to the fight most of his comrades die until he manages to kill the demon king.

4- this isnt the main part of the plot, this is the beginning, the story is mostly him leaving the hell he has created.

5 - hes saved by a girl, child-ish runaway slave type girl who helps him repent.

6 - there is a very funny character, thats way too powerful but has a snail which is surprisingly central to the story, he was pretty comic.

Hey,

I am looking to read some manga. I have a few of my favourite series in paper and I have the Shonen Jump app subscription to find some new series to read.

How do I find other types of manga, that aren't from Shonen Jump? (E.G. Seinen, not sure if this is the correct word)

Is there a legal way to digitally read them? I am fine to buy them, just not sure where. I had a crunchy roll subscription gifted to me but sadly expired and although it had a manga section, in my opinion it was quite bare bones.

So, please allow me to go full TVTropes here.

Some minor spoilers of ""Witch Cratf Works"" by Mizunagi Ryuu

(On Mangadex, Status: Complete)

A resume of plot (Ch. 1):

Takamiya Honoka is your typical Japanese highschool nobody, one vehicular accident to be a isekai MC.
He sits next to Kagari Ayaka, the archetypal perfect girl in every way, intelligent, fit, elegant, rich and beautiful, the princess of the school. 
Her fans are hostile to the extent of harassing anyone who gets close to their idol, so Takamiya-kun is always on the crossfire.
One day Takamiya is suddenly attacked by an unknown force, but he is rescued by a powerful and hot sorceress of fire: Kagari Ayaka.

""Witch Craft Works"" is a great story, and it has all the majors clichés of a harem manga around protagonist: the perfect highschool girl, the magical powerful being girl, the stupid-but-motived enemies girls, the adopted-into-family catgirl girl (x2), the sadistic mistress girl, the only-sane-man-in-the-room girl, the insane obsessed little sister girl, etc...

But none this is enough to make the story collapse into a harem: Kagari Ayaka (the perfect highschool girl, and also the magical powerful being), is way to  over the top perfect and powerful to be even contested by any other of the girls.

So the story goes with more and more witches with deep and deeper interests on the protagonist, even some trying something with Takamiya, but with Ayaka kick them off this road before they get too close him.

Kagari Ayaka single handedly avoid that a harem situation happens on the manga. She is, let's say, a harem avoider, a harem breaker, or even better saying, a harem countermander of the story: the manga demands to have a harem, but she alone says ""No"".

So, after all this, here is the request:

Anyone knows others mangas with harem countermanders like Ayaka in Witch Craft Works to recommend?

so a guy ( i think) he's an astronaut and he goes to another planet that looks like mars, and his rocket that he brought doesn't work anymore so he has to stay in this planet and then he has to figure out what to do because he doesn't have much food anymore after being stuck there for so long and he usually sees someone going to bye or be out side the rocket sometimes.
and one day he goes outside and meets a big big maybe 2.3 meter long alien who is also an astronaut and these aliens are very smart and more developed than humans are.

but the two meet each other and aliens who are highly evolved can speak English like humans and the guy then tells this alien that he needs food so the aliens give the guy food but the guy can't eat it and the guy hasn't eaten in a while so he was super hungry.
I don't know how, but somehow they both figure out that the guy can eat the alien's sperm.

and that's always what I remember, i found this manhwa on tiktok a girl flipped it and i can't find video, i saw it last 2021.

He and woman bro introduce him as woman bro's own sister/cousin so people aren't weirded out at how similar they look to each other (bcs they're the same person). 
It has nsfw elements to it but mainly focuses on woman bro and dude bros relationship and how it changes over time.

manga,"I have been a reader of American, British, French, Italian, and Spanish comics for longer than 15 years, but only got into manga during the pandemic in 2020, since then I have found a bunch of manga I've loved, and some I am still reading through, but I always keep a ""to-read"" list and recently I have been struggling to find stuff I'm interested in. My favourite mangaka is Naoki Urasawa, followed in no particular order by; Taiyo Matsumoto, Makoto Yukimura, Kenji Tsuruta, Daisuke Igarashi, and Usamaru Furuya. I have already read everything they have done that is available in english, but would love to discover other mangakas with similar styles/sensibilities. I have recently been getting into the works of Jiro Taniguchi and Hirohiko Araki, and they seem up my street too. I really liked Osamu Tezuka's Dororo, MW, and The Thief Inoue Akikazu, and am gonna be reading a few more of his books soon. I liked Hiromu Arakawa's storytelling style and the themes she explores in Fullmetal Alchemist, so I'm also gonna check out Silver Spoon, but her art isn't really that much my cup of tea. I love love loved Mushishi, but it seems no other works by the mangaka have been translated into english? Would love to read other similar stuff. I also have been loving Witch Hat Atelier recently, mainly because of how even though there are so so many characters all are explored in a deep and contemplative/introspective way, and no character feels like they are there to just move the story along, reminds me a lot of how Urasawa does character work, even though the concept and style of the stories and the worlds the two mangaka explore are completely different. I have also been reading and quite like Banana Fish, like Urasawa's Monster, it seems to have been influenced by Tezuka's MW a lot, and it's interesting to see the connections, and I always like a good crime story. I am also already slowly reading through; the works of Junji Ito, and some cult classic series like Lone Wolf &amp; Cub, Vagabond, and Berserk.

manga,"I don't remember the title and I've searched all over several manga sites. The fact I can only remember this one scene is bugging my ADHD really bad. I feel bad since what I'm about to say is oddly specific in some places, but oddly vague in others, but I'm hoping someone can magnanimously help.  
What I remember for sure:  
\-Male MC becomes adventurer in a fantay world.  
\-For his first quest he teams up with an elf girl.  
\-Before they head out that morning, they do some drinking.  
\-She heads up to her inn room and disrobes because she feels hot from being drunk.  
\-That morning, she's running later so he goes up to check on her and finds her naked in her room.  
\-Rather than mad at him like he assumes, she's quiet as they walk through the forest because she's worried that he'll think she's a pervert for sleeping nude in an inn or that all elves sleep in the nude. He wonders the same and worries he might've offended her cultural traditions or personal habits.  
\-When they set up their tent that night she finally comes clean and admits what happened and he's completely understanding about it.

What I don't recall for sure:  
\-Whether it was an isekai or not.  
\-Whether it involved RPG mechanics like statuses and skills or not.  
\-I think he sleeps in the tree while she uses the tent, but I might be thinking of another manga.  
\-I think the elf was an archer and the MC a swordsman, but I might be thinking of another manga.  
\-I think the elf was briefly cold-looking when first introduced before rapidly warms up to him and reveals a more cheerful personality, but I might be thinking of another manga.

While the nude walk-in was fun, what really made this scene stick out to me so much was the way it avoids the usual violent assumed-pervert female-on-male double standard, instead having mutual worry over it and then a misunderstanding that is then rapidly settled via healthy communication, something I find is rare in manga.

manga,"so i'm trying to remember which manhwa or manhua it was but there are two i'm in need of help finding!

no images as its been a long time since i read them sorry ;m;

the first one is about a cultivator who can't cultivate but he's amazing at creating items and such in the world he is in, he adopts a demon dog/wolf prince thinking it's like a puppy and eventually gives him a mate via turning a woman into a dog/wolf for him. everyone around him thinks he's some peerless cultivator who's power is so great that they can't feel the sheer power when he actually jsut can't fight at all. that's the first one i need help with.

the second one is a guy who downloads this app where it tells him how to cultivate i think? it helps his poor fishing village gain monetary help via pearls, course women are all tripping over themselves for him too, he also ends up learning that the app has other users and it isn't just him which is where i stopped reading cause i lost track of it but i wanna reread it.

i hope those descriptions are enough to help out, if you need more i can rack my brain around some more to give more info but any help is greatly appreciated!

the first one is about a cultivator who can't cultivate but he's amazing at creating items and such in the world he is in, he adopts a demon dog/wolf prince thinking it's like a puppy and eventually gives him a mate via turning a woman into a dog/wolf for him. everyone around him thinks he's some peerless cultivator who's power is so great that they can't feel the sheer power when he actually jsut can't fight at all. that's the first one i need help with.

the second one is a guy who downloads this app where it tells him how to cultivate i think? it helps his poor fishing village gain monetary help via pearls, course women are all tripping over themselves for him too, he also ends up learning that the app has other users and it isn't just him which is where i stopped reading cause i lost track of it but i wanna reread it.

i hope those descriptions are enough to help out, if you need more i can rack my brain around some more to give more info but any help is greatly appreciated!

manga,"Hi! Trying to hunt down a very niche manga I read on Mangafox in 2015-16 or so. The plot was something like certain people had an infection if they fell in love (or falling in love was an infection and only some people had it?). There was an underground group of infected people, the MC was a girl with short, dark, curly hair and glasses (she looked somewhat like this: [https://i.pinimg.com/736x/bd/28/77/bd2877259c19b6af0ddab3318007ba5b--short-hair-girls-short-black-hair.jpg](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/bd/28/77/bd2877259c19b6af0ddab3318007ba5b--short-hair-girls-short-black-hair.jpg)). On the other side is the police force exterminating all infected people, the MC of which was a detective.

I can get passed fan service, tropes, genre, etc etc as long as the writing is half decent and there are some amount of unique ideas.

I started off with anime and I really have liked Steins;Gate, SpyXFamily, A silent Voice, Neon Genesis, Cowboy Bebop and on the romance side I really like the bunny girl senpai movie (lord forgive me).

manga,"Just staring at my ceiling right now. Need to get some thoughts down on paper. I don’t believe Johan is a psychopath. People so misunderstand this broken soul. 

He was never given any love or affection. A child abandoned. Subjected to experimentation and torture. He loses all meaning to life. Or, he’s never given a chance to develop meaning. It’s stolen from him. He isn’t even allowed a name. He’s a monster, a nameless one. His life is meaningless. Existence is meaningless. He falls into nihilism and boredom with living. 

His sister, his twin monster; shoots him and betrays him. She’s satisfied existing without a name. His only hope of a real human bond, rejects him. But she’s didn’t experience what he did. Even someone whose is physically the other half of him, doesn’t understand him. 

Unable to process his own existence. Unable to process the numbness of his soul after being injected with poison to numb and eventually eliminate his empathy… (yet he’s still able to cry for others earnestly) 

He decides that everyone is capable of becoming a monster.  And he must prove it to himself, time and time again. He must reopen the wound over and over; he accepts it. He’s a monster, but he’s going to prove that everyone else is too until he’s the last one alive on the earth. 

Deep down, I believe he wanted t for someone to prove him wrong. To accept him. Tenma not killing him in the end, because “all life is equal” was the first time anyone has ever offered him that type of love. A recognition of his humanity. 

Until then, people kept disappointing him. 

“Every time I think I’ve gotten to the darkest place in the world, i see an even darker blackness ahead of me”
