I'd have Team Kurenai &amp; Team Asuma beat Kakuzu. It can be some team move between Ino, Choji, Kiba, Hinata, &amp; Shino or some take out the masks while others take Kakuzu on his last stand. Naruto should debut his new move and with throwing feature vs Pain and this allows others to have the spotlight. Them avenging their senseis is better than Naruto just showing up in an arc not about him. This is one of two I'd for sure change.

Kisame and Deidara are tough. Deidara is a shining moment for Sasuke, so I wouldn't change it although my alternative pitch is him vs Neji or Sai which would be fire. I would go with Neji because Neji needed it and since we would get some Deidara vs Sai in the war anyways. The story would need to change a little.

I love Kisame's ending, so this is just a wild pitch. If you wanted to change the story greatly, have Suigetsu be a major player and have him betray Kisame during the Taka alliance. Say Suigstsu and Jugo don't get captured at the Summit. You can have Kisame escape from Guy only to meet Suigetsu who kills him and tells Obito he didn't make it. Suigetsu actually being a threat and collecting the swords would be interesting. Don't know how we get there, but magine a scenario where we get him with his swords vs his reanimated brother with the other swords.

Obito taking down Konan is good, but she should have had a big one on one fight during the main Akatsuki run. I'd have her fight vs Sai in a fight that ends with her winning, but leaving Sai alive due to Pain getting ready to end the leaf. This is the second I'd for sure change. Konan needed a W and showcase.

Let Zetsu not be what he ended up being and just have him fully throw hands with Mei to give her a solo war fight and spotlight before the Madara fight. Onoki, Tsunade, Ay, Gaara all had spotlight beforehand but her. 

Also, not Akatsuki and would require major story changes, but give me major player Anko vs Kabuto in Part 1 with Kabuto barely winning and Anko vs Sage Kabuto in Part 2 with Anko winning, please and thank you.",,uzumakiclan,False,False,[],False,{},,,False,False,True,t3_11gldrl,,dark,True,/r/Naruto/comments/11gldrl/if_you_could_change_how_every_akastuki_member_got/japcwod/,public,False,,[],1677809424,r/Naruto,0,,,,1677809439,1677809440,024c0a64422318e9e3ff3e4655a9d88e12dafc5a,1.0,2023-03-03 02:10:24,

Kage level.

Naruto has nearly raw jonin level skills by the time he got back to the village, with his strength speed and endurance vastly improving.

The only reason Naruto didn’t seem like he improved as much was purely because he was facing villains who were vastly superior to the villains he faced before.

His Taijutsu skills alone became enough that Kakashi needed the Sharingan to be above him, and for Taijutsu that is a HUGE boost.

Even by the stat books, Naruto is only held back on stats by the fact he does not use hand seals a lot and has little skill with them.

He had strength stats equal to Kakashi.

Taijutsu slightly lower.

Yang is the manipulation of the physical energies, changing the body or animating inanimate objects.

Yin is the manipulation of mental/spiritual energies. The Nara clan's shadow techniques, Yamanaka clan mind transfer abilities, as well as most genjutsu, and probably a lot of sealing jutsu.

Tayuya and Kin Tsuchi use sound to perform genjutsu, so yin release. Zaku and Dosu use it more physically (though they also have tools that help them use it, so that kind of makes it a bit murky) but they manipulate it physically so it might lean more into yang release, but jutsu also doesn't necessarily have to have an applied nature and the could just be using chakra to amplify and manipulate the sound from their tools.

Most rocks are insulators meaning there is so much resistance to electricity. Most metals are conductors meaning low resistance to electricity to flow through it. You have to use so much electricity to over come the OHMs of a rock insulator to pierce it. Alternating current counts as vibrating chakra flow.

Solid rock earth &gt; water. Slate and granite are examples of some rocks that are impermeable. I rarely see the ninjas of Naruto use slate or granite to fight water, it is nearly always that brown clay or dirt they sling around. 

&gt;That example you use for why Wind beats fire doesn’t make sense because blowing out a candle isn’t because of air, it’s because of carbon dioxide. Regular air can’t put out fire on less there’s a massive difference in strength between them.

Go out side on a windy day, try to light a cigarrete with a zippo/bic lighter without blocking the wind with your hand. You need to use a presurized butane lighter/torch  that injects more fuel to beat the wind. Make a campfire. 2 or 3 logs need to be sufficiently embered to feed off of a gust of wind.

1) Relieve Naruto of his ""guilt"" from promising her that he'd get Sasuke back

2) Protect Naruto from almost certain death that would come from confronting Sasuke and trying to take him alive

3) Protect her friends from being killed by Sasuke if they tried to kill him without Naruto's help

4) Protect the Leaf Village by taking down their new S-Tier Criminal

Personally I don't really see much of a significance of the whole Ino/Sakura relationship. Maybe because I don't relate, which makes sense since most Sakura fans like her because she's relatable. She nearly all her value if you can't relate to her afterall.

Sasuke valued her as a teammate in Part 1, but their relationship wasn't mutual. Sakura's crush wasn't reciprocated, and he didn't think of her anymore than a friend that needed protection because she was so weak.

Sakura initially had a crush on him because he was cool and attractive, and he stayed that way for pretty much the entire series so her feelings stayed. Sakura would have not still crushed on him if he was ugly lol. Nor is a 12 year old capable of feeling true love.

Sakura is unable to understand him since she hasn't gone through an ounce of what he went through. She also contradicts herself several times during Sasuke's departure because she doesnt know as much as you think.

Kakashi had no idea the Sound 4 changed Sasuke's mind otherwise Sasuke wouldn't have left, and Naruto isn't the type of person to predict Sasuke leaving.

Sakura has Sasuke on her mind all the time cuz she's obsessed with him. Her guessing Sasuke would leave was due to the fact she constantly thinks of him and she was also the only one in Team 7 who heard what Orochimaru said to Sasuke.

&gt;Now here comes her downfall. Kishimoto is such a pigheaded sexist, he literally sent every other random in Sasuke Retirival arc but not her!!? Like bro wtf she's literally his teammate.  


Because she's weak af? Sakura would have definitely died if she went with them.

I think he has a solid chance to beat Kisame. But Kisame can beat more of the Akatsuki than Deidara can, and his losses aren't as severe. But it is close.

&gt;Deidara has more mobility, 

Yes, but also no. Kisame making a lake basically creates an entire area Deidara cannot enter or else he loses without much difficulty. 

&gt;more range,

Sure, but little flying bombs aren't much to worry about.

&gt;and more versatility.

Definitely not. Chakra stealing, water jutsu, top tier Taijutsu/kenjutsu, mass chakra reserves to use jutsu's as much as he wants. All that far exceeds just bombs.


&gt;On top of all that, for all of Kisame's chakra, Deidara still hits harder.

He has a higher destructive capacity,  for sure. But Chakra absorption bypasses durability. So Kisame doesn't need that. Daikodan also makes large bombs less useful.

&gt;And behind that Deidara also has way better hax, see: C4.

That is a busted move, but it wouldn't work on Kisame as he can absorb chakra on his own as well. All the bombs that enter him get their chakra absorbed and nullified. So long as Samehada can sense that chakra it's not useful if they fought. And, it's useless against the other Akatsuki members I put above him. 

&gt;Most of Kisame's power is in Samehada.

I agree for the most part, but it's not that simple. Kisame IS a physical freak with top tier kenjutsu. He does have a massive chakra reserve as well. It still took a 7th Gate Gai to defeat him. 7th Gate Gai slaughters Deidara without a problem as well.

&gt;Which is fine if Samehada was something special that only he could use. Like Itachi's Totsuka Blade which he's bound to his Susanoo, or Orochimaru's Kusanagi blade that he completely controls.

I don't think this matters at all. Samehada loving to eat ONE being more than he likes being with Kisame is absolutely irrelevant to it being a part of Kisames equipment. 


&gt;But Samehada is literally just another living being that chooses to help him.

Which applies to any mastered bijuu and his Jinchuriki. Yeah, Naruto without Kurama is not even close to the same, but why does that matter?

&gt;Kisame + Samehada &gt; Bee (as we see in canon)

Yup, and that Bee would dog walk Deidara. Even without a V2 cloak or upper level V1 cloaks.

&gt;Kisame w/o Samehada &lt;&lt;&lt; Bee (Bee one shots him)

It's not so simple. Kisame is stronger and has a higher combat speed than Base Bee even without Samehada, which is impressive considering Base Bee physically beat a Raiton cloaked A in a power test, and massively outsped MS Sasuke in every category. Any sword would have been fine assuming he can put chakra in it which is a pretty simple thing to do.

Basically, Deidara beats less Akatsuki members or does worse in his losses than Kisame. And same goes if they fought every other character. Kisame would have more wins and beat the stronger people.",,uzumakiclan,False,False,[],False,{},,,False,False,True,t3_11g7gdp,,dark,True,/r/Naruto/comments/11g7gdp/rank_the_akatsuki_from_strongest_to_weakest/jap40vb/,public,False,,[],1677805357,r/Naruto,0,,,,1677805372,1677805373,84c4e837cd64cdb3fd5a36212d2d2e524cc87cef,,2023-03-03 01:02:37,

It's 100% okay and reasonable to have Sasuke as your least favorite and most hated character even if you acknowledge his writing. A lot of people do that.

As an example, people hated how quickly he changed. Not that he switched up, but he made 180° flips after 2 conversations...

&gt;Anyhow, I'm talking about the subreddit specifically. Almost every single poll or post regarding liking certain characters is dominated by more of Naruto fans or others than Sasuke fans. Yet when it comes to writing, Sasuke is what overwhelming majority consider to be better if not best written.

Have you considered engagement numbers? A lot of sasuke fans have little to discuss about the present day because they can't stand his boruto era version, but at least with pt1 and shippuden, they have something to hold on to.

&gt;In my personal opinion, it'd be extremely poor writing if a character was ""consistent with their goals and stuck with same theme"" after learning that they wasted and completely ruined their their entire life on nothing outside of being manipulated into killing the one person who adored them more than any other

It's more the intensity and speed with which he acted. Like if someone tells you your whole life is a lie, how are you going to keep that 100% energy with your next endeavor, especially when it's the reverse. Obviously he would've changed, but it doesn't make sense to a lot from a logical perspective. If you've been burned before, obviously you think before you act. 

&gt;Like, it's 2023 and there are still some people who think he wanted to become a traditional Hokage lol.

That has very little to do with writing tbh. It's 100% okay and reasonable to have Sasuke as your least favorite and most hated character even if you acknowledge his writing. A lot of people do that.

Anyhow, I'm talking about the subreddit specifically. Almost every single poll or post regarding liking certain characters is dominated by more of Naruto fans or others than Sasuke fans. Yet when it comes to writing, Sasuke is what overwhelming majority consider to be better if not best written.

&gt;The primary trait of a well written character is having clear goals and remaining consistent.

In my personal opinion, it'd be *extremely* poor writing if a character was ""consistent with their goals and stuck with same theme"" after learning that they wasted and completely ruined their their entire life on nothing outside of being manipulated into killing the one person who adored them more than any other lol

Though as you said, it's subjective. But I feel like the few who actually dislike his writing (note writing, not character. His character is very easy to dislike even if writing is good) because most don't particularly understand it at all.

Naruto would have been blitzed if Pain was ""fresh"" when they fought.

**2. Itachi** \-  The infinite tsukuyomi was literally based on a technique that only this guy knows.  His Susanoo has the Yata Mirror and the Sword of Kusanagi and his list of hax that can one shot people only goes on from there.  I put him above Obito because unlike Obito understanding Itachi's abilities doesn't make him even slightly less dangerous.  

**3. Orochimaru** \- Former member.  Might be controversial to place this high but his abilities continue to scale higher into Boruto and he has achieved seemingly infinite youth meaning he still hasn't reached the height of his potential. His brilliance as a scientist is factored in to my ranking because prep time makes Orochimaru wildly more dangerous.   
 He is the one who rediscovered and improved on Tobirama's Edo Tensei. That one technique alone played a massive role in the 4th shinobi world war.  Orochimaru has been beaten but he has never been truly killed. His capacity for regeneration is legendary.  Killed Raza and killed Hiruzen and is so dangerous and valuable that the hidden leaf forgave his countless warcrimes.  Played a key role in many events and the lives of many characters.

**4.  Obito -**  His mangekyo is busted strong but he lacks variety.  He has White zetsu recovery potential as well but it seems limited.  He lost in a 1v1 to Kakashi where Pain and Itachi handled kakashi with only low difficulty.  If he had both of his eyes based on how DMS kakashi performed he would be placed higher. 

**5. Kakuzu -** Underestimated by many.  It took a lot to bring this guy down including his own partner foolishly destroying one of his hearts.  around 100 years old and has access to all 5 natures.  He can repair the bodies of other people with his threads making him a pseudo medic.  Otherwise Deidara wouldn't have gotten his arms put back on and Hidan would be headless.   He is also very intelligent and surprisingly strong in CQC.  He kicked Kakashi through a tree fairly effortlessly.  Even a rasenshuriken didn't fully kill this guy Kakashi had to finish him off even after that.  Killed multiple unnamed Akatsuki partners he had previously and once fought Hashirama and survived.  Likely would have killed kakashi in a 1v1. 

**6. Kisame -** Let me say right off the bat I'm not factoring samehada into his power level.  Why?  Because first of all it is something that Kisame didn't even own for most of his life and since Samehada is sentient with a will of its own it is a different being in my eyes not just a tool.  Even without Samehada though Kisame can casually summon a large lake's worth of water and can summon sharks that absorb chakra.  Besides that is extremely resilient with amazing willpower.  With Samehada I think he is stronger than Kakuzu but going off of just innate abilities I think Kakuzu is smarter and more well rounded.

**7. Deidara** \-  His art is an explosion and some of his abilities are surprisingly sophisticated.  He can plant mines, he can make nanoexplosives, and he has a very strong will he is willing to fight after having his arms ripped off, and he isn't a fool infact he has quite a strategic fighter. He defeated Gaara in a 1v1 and nearly took Sasuke's life too.  That being said Deidara is vulnerable to being speed blitzed.   Sasuke nearly cut him down at the very start of their fight and Obito himself said Deidara wasn't fast enough to not respect Sasuke's speed.

**8.  Sasori -**   His poisons are potent and his ability to use 100 puppets is deadly, but he is a child with ultimately a childlike mindset which I think holds him back.  Kabuto was able to fool him and many of the higher ranked akatsuki could blitz Sasori's puppet body before he could deploy the full extent of his abilities.

**9.  Zetsu -**  Not a direct fighter really but I think he has enough utility to still be more useful than Hidan.  He can create multiples of his body and morph through objects  He has Hashirama Cells which are busted. Technically zetsu killed Madara. 

10.  Hidan  -  No surprises here.  He's a one trick pony and his trick isn't even all that good.  Even asuma took Hidan's head off when they fought.   He doesn't know any other jutsu at all besides and is very dumb objectively speaking.   Is likely also vulnerable to basic genjutsu.   He was more of a liability than an asset in my opinion and even injured his partner on accident.",,uzumakiclan,False,False,[],False,{},,,False,False,True,t3_11g7gdp,,dark,True,/r/Naruto/comments/11g7gdp/rank_the_akatsuki_from_strongest_to_weakest/jap104g/,public,False,,[],1677804001,r/Naruto,0,,,,1677804018,1677804018,0dc5ad5f104c74a1893b5b48233f81465a4d278a,1.0,2023-03-03 00:40:01,

Yes if she did, some people hate Sakura as a character as well as those that prefer Hinata and Naruto being together. Hinata was supposedly always going to end up with Naruto since the beginning. There was an interview where someone asked the question about who Naruto would end up with and Kishimoto wanted Sakura to be in a messy love triangle for Naruto and Hinata. There is also a very huge fan base that backs up Sasuke and Sakura being together and the manga even had moments that made it appear that something was there between the two. Supposedly Kishimoto didn't know how bad the hate for Sakura was until the middle of the War Arc and he tried to fix it by drawing her more beautifully on the manga covers. So even if signs pointed to Naruto and Sakura, there would problems.


Yes if she didn't, there were a lot of people that expected Naruto and Sakura to end up together since Naruto was always saving her. It didn't help that there were a lot of parallels with how Kushina and Minato's relationship was like, nor how similar Sakura and Kushina were personality wise with their short tempers and even Minato being reminded of Kushina when he saw how Naruto and Sakura were acting. Kishimoto intentionally threw small nuggets like that but since Naruto was to be more focused on battle than a romance story it wasn't really made clear about who would end up with who with some of the pairings. Supposedly Kishimoto's wife was mad at him that Naruto and Sakura didn't end up together along with a large portion of the fan base mostly Western fans.

All in all, there's no winning for Sakura if she did end up with Naruto or if she didn't end up with Naruto.

You can't say their opinion is right or wrong, because ultimately writing is subjective and the way characters are interpreted and received will be different. Many people will swear to their grave that Luffy from one piece is the best written shoenen mc and i refute it with every fiber of my being. I hate a lot about his characterization.

How about reading the final fight between Naruto and Sasuke, and look closely at how it panned out? Sasuke offered a solution, which Naruto refused for obvious reasons, but in the end he never gave him an answer and just continued with his own version of the system that preaches non-violence.

Sasuke literally had no choice but to comply because his friend would never budge. Which exemplifies how Naruto redeems a villain in the story; beat them and then talk them into not doing the deed anymore, while claiming he'll find a way to solve the villain's woes, which he never went that far with because he kept the same system in place and the current era is at a point where no one would want to oppose Naruto because he's just that powerful and influential. To give an example, Amegakure is left without a leader in the past 15 years and is in a state of disrepair, so while Naruto defeated the leader of Akatsuki and the person who destroyed Konoha, he never solved the problems presented by the villain he redeemed.

No, mastering kuramas chakra is KCM 2, not 1.

&gt;Yea and we see the reason is cuz of how Narutos KCM2 cloak resembles the Hokage clock.

Naruto was literally glowing orange, and kakashi couldnt even see him clearly. It wasnt appearance-based. 

&gt;You missed my point entirely. LEE was the one who actually threw the kunai faster than the truth seeking orbs.

And? 

&gt;Minatos ftg is instant, that does not mean Minato can move as fast as the TSO, only teleport as fast(which is obvious cuz its instantaneous).

Minato teleported between lee and gai, snatched the TSOs and teleported back before they could collide with each other. Thats not just a ""FTG = instant"" situation, that takes serious reaction speed. 

&gt;Once again you miss my point. In terms of Madaras actual combat speed, Minato gets blitzed horrifically and his arm chopped off.

I know. 

&gt;Meaning Minatos reaction speed and combat speed are slower than Juubidara himself.

Yes. 

&gt;Ftg is instant, ofc its faster, the problem is you still need good combat speed to hit your opponent AFTER you teleport to them.

Minato isnt an idiot, he doesnt teleport near or in front of his opponents, he teleports to unexpected directions and hits them before they can get their guard back up.",,uzumakiclan,False,False,[],False,{},,,False,False,True,t3_11g36hj,,dark,True,/r/Naruto/comments/11g36hj/alive_minato_vs_sm_kabuto/jaognjm/,public,False,,[],1677795227,r/Naruto,0,,,,1677795242,1677795243,9f3e5bd77f18bd53ff1c4cd12c52dfb8c6bc7109,,2023-03-02 22:13:47,

Yea this was in reference to KCM1 Naruto, not 2.

Yea and we see the reason is cuz of how Narutos KCM2 cloak resembles the Hokage clock.

&gt;Did you expect minato to throw it with his mouth? 

You missed my point entirely. LEE was the one who actually threw the kunai faster than the truth seeking orbs. Minatos ftg is instant, that does not mean Minato can move as fast as the TSO, only teleport as fast(which is obvious cuz its instantaneous).

&gt;Nope, combat speed is different than FTG speed. Minato cant physically move fast enough to dodge juubidara, but FTG solves that problem for him.
 
Once again you miss my point. In terms of Madaras actual combat speed, Minato gets blitzed horrifically and his arm chopped off. Meaning Minatos reaction speed and combat speed are slower than Juubidara himself.

I never said that punishment is necessary, I even said that the outcome for Sasuke and Oro was fine considering they are not likely to go against Naruto, but they were never held accountable for any of their crimes, which I find to be wrong.

It's not so much that Naruto's ideology is wrong just that his way of thinking and level of forgiveness is not realistic. Naruto is not someone who can fix the system, all he can do is providing bandaid solution and TnJ to keep baddies from going back to their old ways. The story boils down to Naruto being so stupidly powerful that going against him is pointless and suicidal. If Naruto lacked the strength to go against Sasuke, he'd be killed and Sasuke would go on with his plans to be a shadow dictator. He only succeeded because he was that powerful to begin with. Now that Sasuke is willing to assist Naruto in his new world, take them out of the picture and the ninja world will gradually return to its petty conflicts because there isn't a single ninja out there who can match their level of influence and strength.

Naruto's morality is just that shortlived. Think realistically for a second and you'd realize that you can't just force everyone into that kind of extreme compassion, but he does nothing about it and expects people to eventually come around, and he succeeds on some level thanks to being the goddamn ninja Jesus that saved the world from Kaguya.",,log,False,False,[],False,{},,,False,False,True,t3_11fsn0b,,dark,True,/r/Naruto/comments/11fsn0b/why_is_sakura_forgiving_sasuke_the_line_people/jaocsm9/,public,False,,[],1677793701,r/Naruto,0,,,,1677793713,1677793714,df3570a73ff486a129a99d102e891131ada33d69,,2023-03-02 21:48:21,

Konan is called beautiful by Jiraiya. He's not exactly the most reliable source because I feel like he would call any woman beautiful, but I do believe that she's pretty. 

Kushina told Naruto that the only other person who ever called her beautiful other than him was Minato, but actually we have confirmation from Tsunade that Kushina was indeed beautiful, in her last conversation with Jiraiya when they're talking about Naruto's parents.

According to Teuchi and his daughter blushing after they saw what's under his mask, Kakashi is super duper hot as well. And if you're counting filler episodes, since we're talking about omakes, a picture of Danzō in his youth made Tsunade and Shizune all flustered.

Orochimaru&gt;Hiruzen&gt;Raikage : Bee&gt;=Raikage

30% Kisame Clone &gt; Killer Bee

Kisame is believed to be weaker than Jiraiya through feats and statements but this is a debate but let’s say they’re equal at the very least.

Orochimaru has literally always been stronger than Jiraiya. As kids Orochimaru was the talented one basically raised by Hiruzen while Jiraiya was the goofy weak one at first. Jiraiya tried to stop Orochimaru leaving the village way back and lost a fight 1 on 1. Orochimaru without usage of his arms(thus most of his Jutsu and a chunk of his chakra) while also being in a weak host body which was rejecting him thus he was dying tied with a drugged Jiraiya and Tsunade in a 2v1. Tsunade is undeniably the weakest Sannin and is considered mid Kage tier. Jiraiya almost got killed by one attack from a weaker 4 tails Naruto, while Orochimaru casually fights this form of Naruto with a weaker seal(thus making it stronger) while also under stronger zenkai boosts, while still in a dying host body and without his arms still. 

So to reiterate.

Orochimaru &gt; Jiraiya &gt;= Kisame &gt; 30% Kisame Clone &gt; Killer Bee

Let’s not forget Pain stated Jiraiya with intel could take him out and Pain obviously scales above Kisame and Orochimaru still scales above Jiraiya.

And this is all with dying half corpse Orochimaru, war arc Orochimaru is enhanced with a white Zetsu body which is a perfect vessel enhanced with Hashirama cells and always in their prime. And he got his arms back and is no longer sick.

Narrative implies it multiple times. Minato said that naruto would need to master kuramas chakra in order to beat the masked man he FTG-blitzed. Kakashi mistook KCM 2 naruto for minato when he saw him blitzing all over the place.

.....you literally need to react to the movement of the orbs in order to do that. 

&gt;the kunai was thrown by Lee.

Did you expect minato to throw it with his mouth?

Ok so you lied. 

&gt;Why do you think he did better against Kaguya? Doesn't matter if it wasn't verbally stated either, I just added it was stated.

So you lied, got it. 

&gt;Naruto SO6P was much stronger then Sasuke. Example. In the Naruto V Sasuke Final Battle, Naruto used much more chakra and did more work in the war, he was worn out in the fight.

They literally put in equal amounts of work this is bullshit. Naruto is slightly stronger lmao. Sasuke literally said, Narutos going all out in their end fight. 

&gt;Sasuke helped in the war too but didn't share his chakra with the entire shinobi alliance or nearly helped as much.

That was pre SO6P which is irrelevant when they're both God level. 

&gt;Also in the fight Sasuke used the tailed beasts to gain more power, something that wouldn't happen in a scenario between Kakashi vs Sasuke.

I never disagreed on DMS Kakashi beating them. 

&gt;The only reason Sasuke tied with Naruto is because he uses the tailed beasts to his advantage. 

That's literally his power tho??

I'll throw in Akatsuki Sasuke as well I guess.


0. Konan with prep and her choice of field. No one in the Akatsuki is surviving them bombs if she sets them all off at once. 

1. Pain. Even Obito considered him invincible. 

2. Itachi. His War arc feats of clowning on EMS Sasuke’s abilities by saving him over and over put him above Obito. Amaterasu already showed it can't be stopped by Kamui, and Izanami is a perfect jutsu against Obito so I'd have to put him above Obito.

3. Obito. Without Kamui, he is relative to Kakashi. With it, he may not be as hard of a hitter as some others, but he is effectively unbeatable without some kind of insane hax.

4. Kakuzu. He is the most underrated character in the series. He absolutely demolished Kakashi without any difficulty 2 times. Who else has done that? Kakashi couldn't even react to him half the time.

(Late MS Sasuke probably goes around here.)

Between these 4 and the rest of them there is a gigantic gap.

5. Konan. Hear me out, at least in the Akatsuki the people below her really don't have anything to handle her jutsu. Fire is useless, water is useless, cutting is useless she can outbomb deidara, chakra stealing didn't seem to work on her well enough to win despite 4 aburame fighting her. 

6. Sasori. Beat the strongest Kazekage. Gaara, being the absolute tank he is and was, makes that ultra impressive. One hit from him makes you basically useless in the fight.

7. Orochimaru 

8a. Kisame. He doesn't match up well against the Akatsuki. Kakuzu is far more dangerous and well rounded and clowned on guys stronger than Kisame, sasori is a bad match up, konan is a bad match up, Hidan is the only match up that's favorable to him.

8b. Deidara. Top tier reactions. 

10. Hidan. His CQC ability is FAR beyond Asuma who was considered the best in the konoha at CQC(Asuma even forced Kisame to step back and use jutsu instead of his sword). Above the likes of Gai and Kakashi. He kept Kakashi on his back foot the entire time they fought. His durability allowed him to take Bijuu attacks and kakuzus jutsu with no real downsides. In a ""sword"" fight, he should beat Kisame, his water makes the ritual circle kinda pointless.

Jiraya doesn’t need Ma and Pa to transform he needs them to mold the Sage energy so he can maintain it. He also transforms as soon as they are summoned. Chapter 375 you literally see him get attacked before he summons them, he kicks the rhino away and walks out in Sage mode. Ma even says “Lad why do you have to always summon use to rowdy places?!” I would post the exact panel but I’m on mobile. Again chapter 375.

2. Chapter 377. One of the Pains goes to attack Jiraya and gets literally speed blitzed by Jiraya. Pain even says “Not bad…” right after. He also blitzes the fat path with Massive Rasengan in the same fucking chapter.

3. You’re comparing the 9 tails who is over 1k times the size of Ma and Pa. Also the 9 tails wasn’t fighting Hiruzen 1v1 it was on a rampage and was specifically under control by Obito to destroy the village. Him pushing the giant monster out doesn’t mean he can fucking quick scope snipe Ma and Pa. I actually have no idea how you came to this conclusion? Also Sage mode characters have quicker reaction speed, Naruto was able to dodge the 3rd Raikage at close range. 

4. The setting of the battle means nothing. The roads can leap way into the fucking sky. the point is that Jiraya doesn’t have to stand there and fight Hiruzen. He does what he did against Pain which is summon a giant toad and runs around until he summons Ma and Pa.

Kishimoto is inconsistent with his writing, the same way Orochimaru states that the 4 tailed naruto mini bijuu dama could do serious damage to him, at the same time later Suigetsu kinda ""tanked"" (lol) the complete 8 tails blast even tho he kinda was exausted.

Also, it kills me how people pull the ""no development"" card for NH. If my SO was running around holding hands with his childhood friend, telling her he could understand her through her eyes, telling people her dying was the worst pain he ever felt (when you've seen the whole crew dying b4), and was trying to get to her cause 'she mentally called for him,'... Y'all have *too much* development to be ""just friends"" and that's not debatable. 

Finally this whole, ""the last was rushed"" thing drives me mad. Y'all really wanted to watch a 30 plus episode arc of Toneri showing up, pursuing Hinata, then Naruto getting annoyed and brooding, deciding Toneri is bad, spying, and trying to get Hinata to stay away, until she tells him go away, then he gets drunk and emo with team 7 and Shikamaru, and admits he's in love with Hinata and has to win her back from this new dude who conveniently turns out to be a bad dude who's coercing her into marriage? ...

His lifetime dream was to be aknowledged and accepted by the village. Being Hokage was just the materialization of that.

Naruto already [had his moment.](https://naruto-shippuden-anime.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/003-321.png) That moment is probably the exact reason for which Kishimoto never wrote a Hokage ceremony for Naruto.

Sakura can never keep up with Hinata especially in a 1v1 because she is just way too slow for a byakugan and gentle fist master. Hinata would have hit Sakura 64 times before Sakura's perception realizes what went wrong. You Sakura fans are literally delusional to stupidity😂

You really think being a housewife is an insult? Isn't Sakura a single mother whose husband never visits her and her daughter lmfao??🤣 Hinata is still confirmed to be a ninja in the boruto novels. Hinata is rich enough to buy Sakura's family altogether. Sakura struggles with house loans. Hinata is a hyuga heiress. Let that stick in.

Let me tell you how the fight with Hinata and Skaura would go down. Sakura activates her byakugou and launches toward Hinata with her fist. Hinata easily anticipates the attack with her byakugan and dodges easily whole simultaneously hitting Sakura's chakra pool directly, which cuts her chakra flow from the byakugou pool rendering Sakura useless. After that, a 64 palms attack would complete the deed and destroy Sakura's useless life. As simple as that. I didn't even need to include her thinking lion fist or air palm.

SasuSaku is the most popular ship with the Eastern audience though so even men would pick SasuSaku as endgame over NaruSaku. 

The way we see it is that Sakura loved Sasuke who was immensely popular with girls but her love was true because she still loved him even during his downfall. Sasuke truly loves Sakura because she still saw the real him in spite of his misdeeds and it made him genuinely grateful. Similarly Hinata loved Naruto when no one else did and when he was a loser, so her love is true. If Sakura had started to love Naruto her love would be false because she’d love him only after he became somebody. She would be a cruel women as well because she knows that Hinata truly loves Naruto yet she’d still take him for his status.

Part 1: Literally no one is debating this. 

Part 2 battle: Itachi meant to eventually lose the fight, but he was by no means fighting Sasuke with kid gloves on. He had faith Sasuke was strong enough to withstand/counter his strongest attacks, and even admits himself that if it weren’t for Susano’o Kirin would have killed his. Itachi himself acknowledges Sasuke’s strength despite not having as powerful of a sharingan as him at that point in the story.

War arcs: Edo Itachi is solidly below EMS Sasuke in terms of feats. Sasuke does far more impressive things against Madara/Obito than Itachi, with literal bottomless chakra and infinite regen does against Kabuto.

Everything beyond: Without EMS even a theoretical ‘healthy’ Itachi is still severely limited with a base mangekyou.

Didn't I just say it was from early shippuden, which also means it was before Sakura or Hinata became more powerful, which also means it was before she got 100 H as well? Why should early shippuden stat matter? Hinata was barely shown at the beginning of shippuden.


&gt;Also, I did find a source on the Hokage claim, it's the novelization for the Boruto Movie, although I'm certain the line or scene in question was thrown into the anime at some point as well, you can see the source at this link

Then link me the scan o the novel💀 Why do you keep ignoring it? If you found it, show me. I wouldn't believe if you couldn't show me the scan. I have so many Sakura fans lying out of their ass and it seems you are one of them. The link you showed me took me to Sakura's page on Narutopedia. I wonder what use I would have for that? 

&gt;LMAOOOOO, you're still on about this? I just said Hinata is both slower and weaker than Sakura, according to the databooks and feat

And you are still using an outdated databook form early shippuden? The same databook that also says Temari has better stats than Rock Lee? Have you ever wondered why no sane human being used databook as a source due to its misinformation? The databook isn't even written by Kishimoto. Shizune is also more powerful than Sakura, according to that darabook. So what are you going to say about that?


&gt; Hinata is never touching Kaguya. Let's be clear on that

And neither is Sakura ever going to touch Kaguya without the assistance of Naruto, Sasuke, and Kakashi. Did you forget Sakura almost committed just by feeling the presence of Kaguya? 


&gt;we've seen external sources of chakra unblock chakra points before, Naruto's Nine-Tails chakra did this in his fight against Neji, the 100 Healings Seal functions similarly to a tailed beast seal, in that it's a separate pool of chakra accessible via a sealing jutsu, so it's extremely possible Sakura could simply unblock any blocked chakra points with the 100 Healings Seal, not to mention she is a medical nin with regenerative capabilities, so she can probably manually unblock the affected chakra points with medical ninjutsu by hand if she has to.


This is blatantly false. The byakugou seal doesn't work like the nine tails chakra. The reason Naruto was able to unlock his chakra points was because Kurama, a separate entity with a different chakra pool, voluntarily gave his chakra to Naruto's chakra pool. But Byagklugou and curse mark chakra are still connected to the user's system. The byakigou is not an entity that involuntarily releases chakra by itself. It needs activation. If a gentle fist cuts the connection it has with its user, the 100 healing becomes useless. That is the same way Kidomaru lost to Neji. His curse mark chakra got locked, which in turn affected his normal chakra pool and killed him. Thays the fate that would befall Sakura if she ever fought Hinata.

&gt;Whatever copium you're hitting, you need to lay off lil bro. It's not good for you to become this mentally delusional 💀

Debunking Sakuea fans has always been a pleasure for me. Every time I debunk them, they result to guilty comments like this which means they have no other way of debunking or supporting their claims anymore.

1.  Sakura’s “beratement” of Naruto is greatly exaggerated in the anime. She doesn’t hit him or call him and idiot nearly as much in the manga. 


2. Sakura and Naruto are supposed to have a brother/sister bicker type relationship. It’s a common relationship type in television. She calls him idiot, but supports him and his goals for majority of the series and always has his back. Vice versa. They care for each other deeply, but this is just the way Kishimoto chose to portray their relationship.

Ino might pose a surprising challenge, but Naruto is hard to Genjutsu if Kurama has any say in it. Same with Shikamaru, who has been shown to break out of Genjtsu often with no need of external help.

If you can't tell me the exact canon source where it was stated that Sakura was an hokage candidate, I would just assume you are lying and spreading misinformation.

The dayabook Stat you shower me is outdated. That was gotten from early shippuden. It's dayabook 4, isn't it? The same databook literally had Temari in higher stats than Rock Lee. Even Shizune had higher stats than Sakura. So are you going to say Shizune was stronger than Sakura as well?

This is blatant misinformation/headcanon? I don't think you understand how the 100 Healings Seal actually functions. It's not just an ""adds regeneration"" buff, it is an overall chakra-amp, it's just a gateway to access a second pool of chakra that's WAY larger than the user's standard pool of chakra, the whole reason why only a handful of people can use it is because of the precise chakra control it takes to create a second pool of chakra from scratch AND slowly siphon chakra away from your normal chakra reserves to fill the second pool. So when one activates the 100 Healings Seal and gains access to an exponentially-larger pool of chakra, it is an overall chakra amp, all of her physical stats are amped MASSIVELY, speed, power, any jutsus she uses (which to be fair it's rare she uses a jutsu that isn't taijutsu or Summonings), it's this chakra increase that allows her to summon more of Katsuyu at once, and it's this physical amp that allowed her to blitz Kaguya to land a hit on her.

&amp;#x200B;

And Boruto LITERALLY says all of this about Sakura, I don't remember the exact episode but he basically went on a whole tangent about how great Sakura is and how she'd easily be one of the top Hokage candidates if something ever happened to Naruto, you'll have to forgive me for not knowing the exact episode out of 290 where this was said, sorry.

&amp;#x200B;

But if that's not enough to convince you, their databook stats literally tell the same story lmfao, Sakura's stats are:

Ninjutsu: 3

Taijutsu: 3

Genjutsu: 3.5

Intelligence: 4

Strength: 3

Speed: 3

Stamina: 2.5

Hand seals: 4

Overall: 26

&amp;#x200B;

Hinata's are:

Ninjutsu: 3

Taijutsu: 3.5

Genjutsu: 2.5

Intelligence: 3.5

Strength: 1.5

Speed: 2.5

Stamina: 2

Hand seals: 3

Overall: 21.5

&amp;#x200B;

Even the official Naruto Shippuden databooks agree with me that Sakura is stronger than Hinata. Literally the only category she beats Sakura in is taijutsu by half a point, she is inferior in basically every other category as a ninja, she's not as strong, she's slower, she has worse stamina, less Genjutsu resistance, slower hand signs, the databook stats HEAVILY favor Sakura in a fight.",,mybrand,False,False,[],False,{},,,False,False,True,t3_11g0w0w,,dark,True,/r/Naruto/comments/11g0w0w/what_4_takes_out_the_other_7/jan92u9/,public,False,,[],1677777855,r/Naruto,0,,,,1677777874,1677777874,75f9396454c8d85f9b8d70f4e7f3194ec2fc58f5,,2023-03-02 17:24:15,

Yes, and Danzo knew that, right? Whatever Pain’s plan was, doesn’t matter cause Danzo didn’t know, all he knew was that the Akatsuki and its leader were a ticking bomb, even more so after Pain had already destroyed most of the village with his paths.

No, Sasuke was a great friend in general.

2. Since she has to “imagine” him, from what we see, Sarada hangs around ChoCho the most. Leading her to believe her father ;Sasuke; would be the same size as Choji.

Sasuke learned from Itachi, Kakashi, and Orochimaru but he's got sharingan hax so idk feels like cheating.

Sakura was probably the best in my opinion because she was already smart enough out of the academy to take the chunin written exam, she learned tree walking from Kakashi quicker than the other 2, and she soaked up Tsunade's teachings and became sannin/jinchuriki level after the time skip.

Sasuke/Sakura is just egregiously easy to get attention, sometimes it is probably just a matter of trolling, but with over a million members I suppose the constant threads are to be expected as different people post them and have similar issues with it.  


We can agree to disagree. Forgiveness is fine where its warranted and if it adds any substance. I don't see it with most examples of Naruto, he is a very static character, he memory holes things pretty much between arcs as well. He claims to have learned pain from Nagato, but we don't see any examples of him taking this to heart and reshaping the person he ultimately becomes. Aside from my personal distaste for Obito to even be alive, he acts extremely malicious and without a noble cause like Nagato had he just wants to watch the world burn and comes incredibly close to doing so.  


Madara like Nagato had a goal for peace through his own means, but forgiving someone who has done as many heinous things as Madara is absurd. Hashirama was much too nice in that situation and much too dumb to not have thought about how to prevent Madara from leaving in the first place. Probably the least egregious example I listed aside from Gaara who despite being crazy murderous found commonality with someone like him and found a new purpose.

Not going to feed into your Sasuke sob story, I see his fans do this kind of crap to always try and write away the numerous crimes and insane actions he takes. All the villages have child soldiers, but they don't turn into raving sociopaths, so not sure what relevance this has to anything especially when there are others when more jacked up than Sasuke.   


Sakura is more nuts than Sasuke, it was the most one-sided relationship ever and you can reference my last post for a comparison for her. Sasuke repeatedly rejects her and even attempts to murder her on more than one occasion, but she is absolutely convinced he is redeemable and still clings to him. She couldn't kill him because she still has feelings for him and can't bear to see harm and she and Naruto both beg and attempt to excuse and forgive him of taking any form of accountability.  


Her love is that of a young girl infatuated with a boy turned to obsession. He is her pet project that she wants to fix regardless of his interest or desire. This has nothing to do with them becoming a couple later on, the entire point is that it never should have been allowed to happen. It was done little more than for fan service even though the story wasn't conducive to that still happening.   


More fundamentally Sakura is at odds with Sasuke's goal of wiping out Konoha as she herself is still a Konoha shinobi and his hatred has evolved and escalated to any benefitting recipient of Konoha's being an enemy. This goes to an extremely tribal degree where if they aren't of the Uchiha clan he pretty much doesn't even consider them his countrymen. I guess we'll just gloss over all these small inconvenient facts, but sure all we need is Naruto to get into a fight with Sasuke and suddenly he just drops all the insane goals he had been pursuing for hundreds of chapters now.   


Saying Sasuke didn't do ""really bad things"" is just your poor effort at coping for what a monster the kid is and the how he may have been manipulated, but he was still responsible for his own actions. Trauma is not a justification and here is just a short list of things Sasuke is guilty of:   


\-desertion  
\-allying with 2 internationally wanted criminal groups  
\-terrorism  
\-attempted kidnapping (for all intents and purposes the goal was kidnapping)  
\-murder (unknown number)  
\-attempted murder (multiple counts)  
\-assaulting an international conference of political leaders  
\-multiple attempted assassinations of political leaders  
\-successful assassination of a political leader  


Each one of these is already a heavy offense, remember that Kirigakure even has a special unit of Hunter-nins whose entire job is to hunt down and kill deserters. Tsunade even acted on Naruto/Sakura's behalf by not enforcing measures ordinarily employed to hunt down missing-nin. A dereliction of duty on Tsunade's part, but nonetheless Sasuke is a violent ideological zealot with a stated goal of genocide and an effort to usurp the government of the Land of Fire given the village-system is a joint venture.  


So, don't start pontificating to me about all your bullshit excuses. Sasuke would at minimum get life in prison and most nations would have likely executed him for his actions. Couldn't allow him to face real consequences though, he gets a slap on the wrist with a short prison sentence and freedom to come and go as he pleases just because he helped take out a mutual enemy in Kaguya/Madara who were at odds with his own plans anyway.  Sasuke choosing to turn into a dead beat dad and adopting Danzo's old job is hardly what I would call justice. Most of Sasuke's atonement could be chalked up to personal decisions he made and everyone just kind of went along and allowed it. 

Sasuke can seek to be an avenger but he can't have his cake and eat it too. You are either an avenger or you move on from it and lead a more normal life like Itachi intended.

Secondly here we go, and you better read it all bcoz I'm about to waste a hell lot of my time.


Now her relationship with ino is one of the  most realistic thing I've read in mangas and kishi legit a genius for this. 

Sakura was your typical bullied girl, due to her intovert nature and low self esteem bcoz of bigb forehead but ino, a popular girl, decided to befriend her. Sakura then started Idiolising ino, her confidence grew bcoz of ino, she had new friends and over all her life was better. But she was still in ino's shadow, she was still a 'second' to her, almost her lacky. Ino did not consider Sakura her equal, (it's all in that flashback during chunin exam btw) and Sakura wanted to be ino's equal. 

I've been thru EXACT same thing with my own best frnd. I was in her shadow. Altho I loved her for being my bsf at the same time I wanted to be more than just her 'best frnd', wanted to create my own identity, and I took kind of the same route as Sakura. One of the best decision I ever made as a middle schooler. 

Sakura and ino like most other girls had crush on that cool guy and this was a very good opportunity for the 9 year old to create her own self and become ino's equal. So she broke up with her. She started competing with her. Sasuke was a very good source for competition b/w two early teen girls. Same as Sakura was initially for sasuke nd naruto. 

 Nd later during the chunin exams Ino finally acknowledged Sakura as her equal. 



Now back to her relationship with sasuke. Let's be real, ain't no way in hell was her 12 year old ass in love with sasuke. This was a mere infatuation. Nd he was like a prize to be won over. But this started changing when in chapter 4, sasuke told her about his goal of taking revenge nd about itachi. 

And besides, during chunin exams she was literally willing to raise her hand to quit and take one for the team, even though she was the only one to know every single answer, simply so that naruto does not fail in the written test and his dream to become hokage washes away in drain. 

Nd y'all call her a heartless bitch😒

Anyways back to sasuke. So we have chunin exams, here both our macho men were beaten down nd she a weakass genin with just a kunai stood against opponents far superior than her, just to save those two guys asses. She a better person than me, I wld have left them to die fr if it meant me breathing. 

Nd then y'all call her spineless. 

Anyways now comes my most favorite part of that whole naruto + boruto serves. Sakura was the first person Sasuke avenged. Bro literally bought out his demons to kill the people who hurt her. Like he's sooo romantic omg!!! Anyways, here we debunk that good old ""sAkURa OnLy LiKeD HiM fOr hIs lOoks"" Bcoz she saw his worst and instead ended up falling even harder for him. 

Nd btw Sasuke very clearly naruto to keep salura safe when she went unconscious against gara bcoz ""she was one of the last remaining precious person"". 


Now one of the most important parts for Sasuke and sakura's relationship and sakura's character, sasuke's departure :

Most of y'all say that Sakura knew jack shit about him, and that the only thing she cares about is his dick and blah blah

So tell me then why was she, out of the whole team seven fiiled with traumatised orphans, one being a jonin, the only one to notice that Sasuke was going to leave the village?? 

When naruto was celebrating his win and asking her for a date, she was worrying about Sasuke on the basis of what she saw in the hospital. 

She loved him enough to willingly leave that damned village alongside him. She understoof him and his pain and his motives too. She knew him so much as to correctly guess his moves. No wonder she annoyed him lmao

Now here comes her downfall. Kishimoto is such a pigheaded sexist, he literally sent every other random in Sasuke Retirival arc but not her!!? Like bro wtf she's literally his teammate. 


So here ends the part 1. 

Do u want me to write about shippuden too?? I don't want to so how about we call it a night and u can continue hating her bcoz ik ain't nothing gonna change your perception about her lol. As for me, her flaws make her more lovable.

Orochimaru has a crazy amount of nin-justsu. He went 1 on 1 with 4 tailed naruto while paralysed (arms not working). He canoniclly had a draw in a fight vs Pain.and his skills were saud to rival Minato (he was so close to becoming the 4th Holage).

The only true loss while at full strength was to Itachi and that was due to Itachi having better Gen-jutsu.

And overall I can only speak for myself.

Charakters grow in that show quiet far and Sakura had a long way too. In Boruto she is finally calm and got her act together. That crybaby is gone, it's quiet the relief actually. I like to watch her now actually.

In Naruto she was a 12 year old girl obsessed with her crush and cared about nothing else. Being annoying as a character like this is inevitable and kinda the point of hers in part one. 

In Shippuden she is finally a konoichi worth to mention and someone to account for (Sasori fight). I still found her annoying overall (sometimes funny) because on the inside she was still that little girl from part one. But those games she pulled on her comrades made me sick (on Naruto land of iron, kiba lee sai on their way to kill Sasuke) as well as the whole ""relying on Naruto stuff"" / ""who am I gonna save first if they fight, Naruto or that terrorist?"" 

For me over all she is quiet the pain to watch. I always roll eyes on Sakura up until the war arc (except when she fights).

BUT that character made me feel stuff and had it's purpose and effect on others Charakters progressions, so I do like that. I think it was necessary.

Alive minato, along with other edo hokages, was stated to be the strongest soldier in the shinobi alliance when they first arrived to the battlefield, even with edo tensei nerf.

Sage kabuto is outright stated to be stronger orochimaru. He was capable of fighting with and overwhelming edo itachi and EMS sasuke at once, though they were holding back and limited by the environment. He has a fuck ton of jutsus, hax and the location control he has gives him a gigantic edge.

It's difficult to say imo. Kabuto has a LOT of hax that minato has no counter for, and his environmental control will majorly fuck up a guy like minato who relies a lot on evasion. However, minato (especially with edo tensei feats) is so much faster, more talented and more intelligent than kabuto that I cant see what kabuto can possibly do if minato takes the offense and just presses him right off the bat. Imo, kabuto takes it in character, since in character minato starts out slow and tries to figure out his opponents at first, which leaves him quite vulnerable for kabutos hax for some time.

Actually no. Bee's lariat tore right through his lung, he had to use samehada to regenerate the damage. [Here](https://images.app.goo.gl/SrADAHfKmTFYdi2i7). Oh and this was despite kisame defending himself against the larait....

The thing is hirodura has a characteristically large range, I wouldn't go so far as to say all gas and no substance but it's blast radius is definitely exaggerated.  When it comes down to it, it cannot even make a person bleed sakura(having surpassed tsunade) should be able to survive even being cut in half. I don't see how she wouldn't regenerate from it tbh. 

Let's look at it a different way, every action has an equal and opposite reaction meaning sakura must have the durability to tank her own attacks.

Sasuke and sakura are integral characters without whom the story won't exist in the first place.  


But from what we've seen from the story it's clear that Sasuke is far more integral to the plot/story than Sakura.

Sakura was created as the main female, but ended up not contributing nearly as much as her other Team 7 teammates. Ultimately her being the heroine holds relatively little value.

&gt;The show is named naruto, not Sakura, ofc he bought him back single handedly bcoz that's literally what he's made for. Secondly kishimoto's terrified of women /s  


So that's the excuse for Sakura not doing anything to help bring back Sasuke? If that's the case her having the intention to bring back Sasuke should have been scrapped.

&gt;Third, I don't want to but if u say I will write a damn essay breaking down Sakura character for u to comprehend it more than thru a tinted glass of ""boy crazy"" bs. I've spent two years obsessing over her and I can say it assuredly that she's much more complex nd her motivation was not just marrying her childhood crush. and yes i agree she's not the best written shonen girly out there.  


I've come across plenty of Sakura fans who had their own view on her character. Quite a few of them were obviously bias and instead of taking info at face value, they instead overanalyse her character which is exactly what Sakura stan accounts do on twitter, tumblr etc.

The fact is that she had Sasuke as her primary motive in Part 1. Shippuden also had her character focus on Sasuke except she also had an alternative motivation which ultimately linked in with Sasuke since her wanting to improve herself and not be a burden only happened after Sasuke left. 

&gt;yes i agree she's not the best written shonen girly out there.

Oh... Then you would need to prove which uchiha he has faced that has genjutsu on the lvl of EMS Sasuke. He didn't even face anybody with an EMS before.

Sigh mate. 1) Sasuke doesnt specialize in genjutsu, Tobirama faced countless uchihas in the war including big boys like Madara (he had EMS you know), Izuna (he killed that one), one of his trusted ninja was Kagami Uchiha the father of Shusui Uchiha one of the best genjutsu users in the Naruto manga (no need to count Boruto for this) his genjutsus were pretty nasty (Gengetsu Hōzuki was also pretty good genjutsu suer).  


There is also literally no scource that EMS genjutsu &gt;MS genjutsu. EMS is MS that doesnt go blind more or less. Tobirama personalyl faced at least 2 MS users and both were the top of Uchihas back there so I dont really see a problem there. If it was that simple to kill Tobirama, just genjutsu him, after all either Madara or Izuna would kill him thats pretty reasonable take.  


&gt;What water countering Amaterasu?  


Edo Tensei does that pretty well, the parts aflame burns to ash..But thats not likely debilitating enough to prevent edo tensei to regenerate the body afterwards. At the very least you had to had something at the Trusth-Seeking Balls level which Sasuke did not had.  


&gt;He is above Tobirama, he tracked and reacted to Juubito's speed who is far above tobirama,  


Tobirama himself reacted and countered Juubito. Tobirama isnt slower enough if even than Sasuke before his War power up.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Only problem here is the edo tensei body but Orochimaru is the one that revived him so...

Madara stated and performed that if you know the seals you can get out of the control and even prevent the summoner from releasing you. Granted there is some consistence with Orochiromaru trying to overrule Tobirama will, but just per the logic.

Okay, she’s a bad ass, strong af and smart and good in a medical situation but her courage and ability to act without thinking wasn’t ever all that good until she became a mother and it pieces her character together soooo nicely. 

I totally agree with this. Mom and medic Sakura is so great and i totally enjoy every bit of content we get from her in that regard and while i find Sakura very badass on top of being obviously very strong her actually fighting is very boring tbh. 

I'd like to squeeze in how much i enjoy Ino's glow up as the leader of Konoha's security!

Naruto is obsessed as well, but atleast he has some pretty obvious motives other than Sasuke. Him wanting to be Hokage and breaking the cycle of hatred are the major ones.

Also Naruto actually achieved his goal in bringing back Sasuke nearly singlehandedly. Sakura did pretty much nothing to help bring him back despite Sasuke being her main goal.

&gt;But ofc it's sakura, that little girly, who gets the slack. Besides just read the manga please, you'll see that her character is way beyond just sasuke's love interest and her main motivation was to catch up to both him and naruto so that she wld not remain as a dead weight.  


Excuses. Maybe stop with the bias and realise Sakura's character revolves around Sasuke, and she wouldn't even be a character without him. That motivation of not being dead weight was only formed because she couldn't do anything to bring back Sasuke.

Even Madara was very good at fighting senjus, so why aren't we extending that same blanket statement to him and saying he whoops tobirama cause he beat other Senju's?    
Do you know what by extension means? Just cause he beat izuna doesn't mean he's beating the god of the uchiha's that can make Hashirama acknowledge him

I don't really understand the point you're trying to make, here. What answer is that supposed to give me, other than he got a fictional crush on her because she's a good and compelling female character? 

&gt;And even in Toph you can see the gender stereotypes. She’s a tomboy and there’s nothing girly about her, because girly stuff were seen as “weak”. Lmao. You can’t compare Toph to Sakura.

She's the character who's crying the most in the show, she acts kind of like a spoiled princess in her first couple of episodes, and she does have a girly crush on boys. Girly stereotypes are just not all there is to her character, which is what makes her interesting and well-rounded. 

Korra, in the sequel, was my brother's favorite character when we watched it. Just because she's the strongest character of the show, and she's fun, confident and enjoys kicking asses.

My point is that boys *will* admit to have a female character as their favorite one with absolutely no problem, if the character is cool.

It was stated by Itachi, can't find the manga page now, but here is the [wiki where it also states they were equals](https://narutofanon.fandom.com/wiki/Izuna_Uchiha)

&gt;he would be the one who would have got Madara's eyes. 

Why would that be? Izuna acknowledged his brother as the better leader, and Willingly gave up his eyes.

&gt;We don't know if that fight was even 1vs1 or if Izuna ever used the susanoo. 

If it wasn't, it would have been mentioned.

&gt;Hashirama himself considered Madara his rival

And? Dosent change the fact that Madaraa by himself was nowhere near Hashirama's level.

&gt;Tobirama got dicked by kinkaku and ginkaku ffs, they're on the same lvl as 6 tails Naruto. Madara could suppress full kyubi.

There is a thing called battle tactics. If Kinkaku and Ginkaku could beat tobirama, it simply meant they countered him or tonirama's ability didn't match against theirs. 

However it is Canon that Tobirama could beat Izuna, and by extension Madaraa as they use the same tatics, and Tobirama was very good at fighting Uchias. 

These fights aren't like Dragon Ball where whoever has the biggest power level wins, the power system is very defined with certain jutsus having hard counters and being stronger against some things then others.

For instance Tobirama apparently can protect himself against Genjustu, he can avoid big susano attacks with ftg, can counter the Uchiha's fire attacks with his water, use shadow clans to confuse the sharingans so it's harder to hit him with Amaratsu, etc.

Tobirama is just speced for 1v1s, and espically against Uchias.",,uzumakiclan,False,False,[],False,{},,,False,False,True,t3_11fvoyx,,dark,True,/r/Naruto/comments/11fvoyx/lets_say_tobirama_fights_sasuke_at_this_moment/jamcmyl/,public,False,,[],1677764534,r/Naruto,0,,,,1677764548,1677764548,0d8a535713c2b0d075287666e95ba6764ee4a162,,2023-03-02 13:42:14,

Izuna wasn’t almost MS Madara lol. That’s like saying Tobirama was almost Hashirama level. Just nah. 

Him being really good at water style doesn’t matter… Sasuke is “really good” at Jutsu too. Specifically Lightning which counters water.

Yeah but the lack of showings means we don’t exactly know how she’d apply this in battle. What if KCM used his arms to evade or move in the same vein he did against Nagato for example? 

&gt;Though there is somewhat of a movement speed feat in their last scan.

&gt;We can see that there's a good bit of gap above Kaguya and rest when Sakura started jumping down

&gt;And then Sakura manages to close it fairly fast, getting close to Naruto and Sasuke's position as they touch Kaguya

&gt;Of course, Naruto and Sasuke are going off the force of what they jumped from so it's not comparable to their speeds, but it's still quite impressive tbh. Regardless, even if you don't want to consider this valid, the fundamental thing still applies.

Ironic.

Thats not the page in question anyway. 

&gt;Sasuke has a single bead of sweat going down his face but is otherwise ready for a fight. His face is angry and determined. Not scared in the slightest.

Every time sasuke gets this look on his face, he is either in DEEEEEP shit or in a situation that is beyond his capabilities. 

&gt;Jugo is also only lightly sweating. Orochimaru just looks mildly concerned, but confident that he could stop Tobirama if needed. Only Suigetsu is scared. 

Jugo, suigetsu and sasuke were all visibly shook and scared. Only orochimaru was cool. 

&gt;It is only after Hashirama puts his foot down that shockwaves start forming. Jugo gets scared enough to cover Sasuke, who himself is more shocked than scared, and only then does Orochimaru gain a bead of sweat. Suigetsu melts comedically.

No one denied hashirama was more frightening. 

&gt;The people in that room were scared of Hashirama. Tobirama was just being an uppity brat, throwing his chakra around, and got scolded for it by Hashirama.

Nope it never was the fact that Naruto was fighting longer and shared chakra with every shinobi makes it even more obvious naruto was stronger.

Also this was clearly MS madara which isn't as strong as his EMS self and we can see that EMS actually gives the user an amp. That madara got defeated by hashirama whereas EMS madara even without kurama managed to exhaust sage mode hashirama.

Minato is only better at FTG nothing else.

Also they were S rank ninja before the kyuubi amp and was way stronger with it. He only died to them when they had 18 other shinobi with them and this was when he was already tired and depleted not even at 100%.

ah yes the Databooks the most reliable source of information like how they said Hebi Sasuke is strong enough to defeat any member of the Akatsuki lol.   


Madara and Hashirama are equals.   


There is no way Izuna = Madara, because that would imply Tobirama &gt; Izuna = Madara =/&gt;Hashirama and we both know there's not a single world out there where Tobirama can defeat Madara nor is equal to Hashirama. Those two are easily out his league.   


Minato is stronger than Tobirama lmao.   


It doesn't matter how you look at it, Tobirama nearly fucking died to Kin and Gin who were both at max two 6 Tailed V2 Kurama Cloaks, and by the war arc that level of power is absolutely nothing.  


Minato has better feats than that, Since Minato managed to fight both Ay and Killer B in a 1 v 2 and actually stood his ground rather who combined would be stronger than Kin and Gin, which makes Minato stronger than Tobirama.   


Tobirama is so fucking overrated bro. I cant stress this enough he nearly died to Kin and Jin themselves lmao and was later killed by those with his their group, and he didn't even defeat that Group or kill them or do anything it was just a straight up suicide mission.

A death which we have basically no details on. Also massively downplaying Kingaku who alongside Gingaku were considered kage level threats who were the most dangerous criminals in Kumo history. 

&gt;the absolute highest you can peg Tobirama is 6 Tailed V2 Kurama, and that's weaker than Naruto's 6 Tailed Form when he fought Pain. 

Tobirama killed Izuna Uchiha with ease. Who was at least MS Madara level. He was also considered the fastest ninja alive in an era where Madara, Hashirama and the 2nd and  3rd Raikage existed. 

Sasuke is not touching him. 

&gt;And then we have EMS Sasuke who is told to us and shown to be KCM 2 Naruto's equal.

Stop the cap. KCM 2 Naruto single-handedly fought 7 Bijuu and no sold 7 Bijuu Dama Bombs with a slap. 

A single Bijuu Dama would not only vaporise Sasuke, but it would also wipe out nearly 10-20km worth of land around him. EMS Sasuke had no yet awakened his perfect Susanoo until the S06P basically gave it to him. 

Let's be real. If 4th Ninja War Sasuke faced Naruto, he would get annihilated.

&gt;KCM 2 Naruto is vastly stronger than 6 Tailed V2 Kurama cloak, aka what Kinkaku has access too.

So basically your argument is predicated on the belief that

Sasuke = Naruto &gt;&gt; Kingaku &gt; Tobirama


The problem is your placement of Sasuke's power level is wrong. Sasuke is NOT Naruto's equal, and Tobirama's death was the result of an ambush, not a 1-1.

Going strictly by feats. 

Tobirama has blitzed both Izuna and Sage Madara, with speed and reaction times far beyond anything Sasuke has ever shown.

Kakuzu encountered Hashirama and survived to tell the tale. That's all. For all we know Hashirama could have slapped him down and let him get away as a show of mercy. Tobirama meanwhile canonically got bodied even with backup.

Sasuke was a match for a fully mastered KCM 1.5(with the popped hood but no cloak or avatar) Naruto. And arguably an equal to KCM 2 Naruto without sage mode, since two minor amps(Kurama's regular red cloak plus Jugo's curse mark) bridged the gap between him and KCM2 Sage Naruto.

A fought a freshly transformed and barely trained KCM 1 Naruto who hadn't even fought in the form up until then. And he had his fastest attack dodged at point blank. 3rd Raikage, who was A's equal or superior depending on interpretation lost to a shadow clone of that same Naruto.

Tobirama caught an unstable Juubito who didn't even know his own identity much less his surrounding by surprise. He blew apart a torri gate that had already withstood a juubi blast and was probably seconds from collapse as it was, these are both unquantifiable feats.

Shikamaru, Choji, possibly Sakura, and Hinata might be able to beat Lee, but it would be difficult I feel. I feel Shikamaru against the others would be so good at analyzing a counter, he’d be a good matchup against everyone. And with his Shadow Manipulation Justu, it gives him a solid flexibility against most people.

Choji I feel outside of Lee and Shikamaru has a lot of strength and durability with his expansion jutsu to win against the others. The question is can someone like Sakura use her raw strength to counter Choji when he’s giant? I feel like Sakura might struggle some with that alone. Now, summoning Katsuyu would help a ton against Choji, so there’s a good chance Sakura could beat Choji but I’m not gonna guarantee it.

Hinata I think could handle several of them, but then struggle a lot against a few. I think Lee is too fast and strong to make the Byakugan viable. I think Shikamaru’s Shadow Manipulation Justu would give Hinata too much trouble. And I don’t see Hinata blocking off Choji’s chakra flow while he’s big. Against Sakura, she could maybe win if she can cut off Sakura’s chakra. Sakura is pretty much useless without her chakra. All her abilities rely on it. But that’s if Hinata can get the chance to use gentle fist.

Sakura I think has a good chance against everyone, except for Lee and Shikamaru. I think Lee’s speed and strength would give her quite a bit of trouble. I don’t think it’s a guaranteed victory, but I do think Lee has a good chance of winning. Shikamaru just has to connect with Sakura’s shadow to likely shut her down. I do think Sakura could maybe overpower Shikamaru, but I wouldn’t be confident in it. 

Shikamaru is easily the best at analyzing and coming up with counter strategies. And he’s got a good variety of flexible Shadow Manipulation Jutsu that’s good at disabling people. The issue is he’s not the most proficient at Taijutsu. So I think anyone with enough speed and skill at Taijutsu would overwhelm him. Lee, Choji, Sakura, and maybe Hinata could beat Shikamaru in this regard. I think Shikamaru would be a tough victory due to his analysis skills alone.

Temari I think would struggle against the previous aforementioned individuals, but likely would do okay against the others. We saw Temari hard counter Ten Ten. Her wind jutsu also is a strong counter against Sai. And Ino is such a niche support that she would struggle to make contact with her mind transfer jutsu.

Sai I feel has a similar issue Ino has on her own, his drawings only work decently with support. He’s not that good at Taijutsu, or never showed any particular affinity for it. Doesn’t have Genjutsu. His drawings function kind of like how Shadow Clones are meant to be used, on top of being able to seal. I think his drawings would give Ten Ten and Ino some trouble, but it’s nothing I’d consider a major struggle. Everyone else I feel has some kind of answer or hard counter to Sai.

Ten Ten has the unfortunate fate of being a minor character that sometimes gets treated as a major cast member. Kishimoto did her dirty. I think her concept of being a weapon’s master has nice potential, but unfortunately ended up as underwhelming. In a world where magical god wizards exist, she sadly is greatly weakened. Ironically, Ten Ten might be one of the more accurate Shinobi when compared to irl Shinobi, but I digress. The only one she can maybe beat is Ino, but then again Ino is even more of a joke.

You know, out of all the memes calling Sakura useless, people forget that Ino exists. I hate to say it, but Ino is a discount Sakura. Ino basically has two things going for her. One, hee Mind Transfer jutsu that rarely works. And two, medical jutsu. Except, she’s average at medical jutsu. She can’t summon Katsuyu, she can’t use the regenerative jutsu Tsunade and Sakura have. As far as I know, she can’t even focus her chakra to hit super hard like Sakura and Tsunade can. 

You wanna know what Ino was able to do during the war? She was basically a human voice chat service. While useful, she’s borderline a joke. There’s no way Ino is bodying anyone else. Her Mind Transfer jutsu is too risky on her own, and she’s got literally no other unique or powerful skills and abilities to assist her. 

The other person I know nothing about, I don’t even remember her name. She shows up like twice in the manga, and barely did anything. So I’m not including her.

So, if I had to give an honest ranking from most likely to win a 1v1 scenario against the others, to least likely, which is how I’d gauge strongest to weakest, I’d definitely put Lee first. 

The next 3 are hard to place. I wanna put Shikamaru next only because I feel his ability to assess things and to strategize against everyone else is likely a good hard counter except for Lee. You could easily argue to have Sakura as second for reasons that she has enough physical prowess and use of Katsuyu to hard counter Shikamaru. 

Choji I feel would struggle a bit too much against the aforementioned 3, so I’d put him 4th. The rest are pretty simple. Hinata is 5th, Temari 6th, Sai 7th, Ten Ten 8th, and Ino 10th. The girl I didn’t mention anything about can have 9th, there’s no way in hell Ino is stronger. People are too distracted by Ino’s personalities a lot of times to notice how much she lacks in skills. She should stick to flower arrangements, at least she’s decent at that.",,uzumakiclan,False,False,[],False,{},,,False,False,True,t3_11f8u44,,dark,True,/r/Naruto/comments/11f8u44/rank_them_from_weakest_to_strongest/jalqyks/,public,False,,[],1677749858,r/Naruto,0,,,,1677749871,1677749872,f195732fd2e363bfaeadba6a9f643779628a28fc,1.0,2023-03-02 09:37:38,

I don't understand how this subreddit can both be completely ignorant about how real humans work and then turn around and act like they are professional human psyche understanders.

Sakura loves him and understands that he went through shit that real life people honestly couldn't. And that he realized his mistake and tried to be better. She even started a psychiatric wing in the hospital to make sure people with mental trauma could be helped because she actually understands that you can't expect people to heal if you don't give them opportunities to get better and instead force them to become child soldiers.

Sasuke did a lot of shit (But honestly he didn't even do really bad things. If Naruto doesn't press changes he's not even on Page 1 of ninja criminals) but mainly because he was driven basically insane by his family issues and the leaf village being real evil shits. If you think Sasuke doesn't have a point wanting to attack the leaf (not that it makes it right) then you need to actually read the manga and not just watch Youtube Videos about it. And then he got beat by Naruto and learned he can't force the world to become a less shit place and honestly tried to be a better person.

Mofo was 13 and went through a severe trauma of being crushed by a huge ass rock, was saved only by creepy grandpa who filled his head with bullshit and then his best friend died by the hand of his other best friend for whom he died.
Obito and Nagato are literally the same - orphan kid no one cares about - forced to fight in a war while way too young - find friend that cares about them, said friend commits unalive to protect others (Yahiko to protect Konan, Rin to protect the village) - orphan loses it and starts hating the world. 

The only difference is that Rin jumped into someone else weapon, not Obito’s, and it doesn’t make it better.
Obito’s struggle is even higher than Nagato’s, because, through it all, Nagato still had Konan and (in the beginning) no creepy old man to manipulate him and he pretty much has a genetic predisposition to insanity because of the amplified way he feels emotions such as love or loss. 

Why does it changes the stakes because Obito had a crush on Rin? He still lost his best friend that was the only person his age that ever gave a shit about him, just like Yahiko was with Nagato.

Tsunade is by far the best female kishi has written in this series. Tsunade didn’t need to “earn respect” from the very start she is considered equally as respected as the other two sanin and she doesn’t feel she needs to catch up. Her story was a lot deeper than having a “crush” on a 10 year old. 

Sakura whole thing sinc the start of Naruto was that she felt useless. It honestly looked they were trying to go somewhere with this plot line and her development of medical ninjutsu and tsunades strength. But it didn’t. She is constantly behind doesn’t get any fights after the first arc of Naruto shipudden. And half the time instead using her power to heal she is the one being saved. Biggest example 4 tails Naruto vs orochimaru. Sakura literally fought no one and got knocked out twice….

Her obsession with sasuke is really weird and I don’t know how it was justified for the entire series Naruto made sense. Both had no one and had terrible childhoods. The two understood each other and had a deeper connection. Sakura literally had a crush as a 10 year old… that’s it. There was an interesting point where she actually thought of killing him but sadly in the final arc this completely un done(also the next time the two meet again). She starts saying stuff like “I wanna be strong so I can fight by sasuke”. How they ended up a couple is very weird. 


But boruto Sakura is better imo. She got her a first actually fight that doesn’t make her look useless. She is more of a mentor figure and doesn’t need to chase peoples respect since it’s been earned and has a good reputation in the leaf. It’s nice to see Sakura not looking useless, and obsessed with sasuke like she was before.

I gave mine based off of the evidence I saw from the show/manga. I'm not invested in this enough to research their ninja info cards lmao. 

I agree that Hinata might not *want* to attack Naruto seriously, but after some dialogue, I'm sure they would both respect and encourage each other to give it their all. That's part of their ninja way. To go easy on each other would be an insult. 

Maybe Naruto could have made some clones before she struck him, but one gentle fist strike would take out a clone, easy. They wouldn't last long or cause much trouble, especially if Naruto was at a point where he could only make four at a time. Her taijutsu isn't amazing, but she can see nearly 360° with byakugan, so being surrounded by 5 Narutos isn't as much of an issue for her as it was for Kiba. 

Naruto was *severely* damaged by Neji's serious blows and only just *barely* came out on top because he used Kurama's chakra. That wasn't an option in the prelims because of Orochimaru's seal. I mean, we literally see Naruto's kyuubi-rage-mode *turn off* once the seal was placed on him. 

I'm not calling Naruto weak by any means, but he was not in good shape at all in the prelims. I'm also not convinced Hinata is as weak as you say. Neji beat her easily because he's a prodigy, but she put up a good fight.

Same argument goes for Obito and Naruto. So Naruto forgiving Obito for murdering his parents and thousands of innocents is valid because Obito helped in the war, but Sakura forgiving Sasuke isn't, even after he helped the allies win the war?

In Obito's case, he had only lost his crush Rin, there were many others whom he cared about deeply and vice-versa. So imo, if Obito had thought of the dreamy Infinite Tsukiyomi after he had maybe lost both Kakashi and Minato, then it would've made a lot more sense than the current one.

Okay true that, Kaguya's speed was &gt;&gt; theirs DURING that moment, but I agree both should be capable of moving at faster speeds under normal circumstances.

&gt;Yeah but she has no actual speed feats using that.  


C'mon, we know how the ability works and that Sakura focuses chakra on feet to gain burst movements. And we know she boosts her power in same manner. If one thing is top top tier, she can definitely be hella impressive in another as well. You have to agree to this bit. Just because there are lack of showings doesn't mean fundamental workings will change!

&gt;Kaguya moving towards her won't change the speed at which Sakura can move her fist, right?

It will change the speed at which Kaguya gets back to Naruto and Sasuke though. How fast Kaguya is moving &gt; how fast she gets punched &gt; how fast she gets sent back to Naruto &amp; Sasuke

&gt;The fact that she's able to react to Kaguya's speed (which is &gt;&gt; fate brothers there) and punch her itself is insane. Definitely more insane feat than KCM Naruto's ones in regards to attack speed.

That’s not &gt;&gt; Naruto &amp; Sasuke, as they both are only propelled by their initial jumping force at this point, especially Sasuke, who had to bounce off of a Naruto clone to get in place.

&gt;Speed and power for Sakura are correlated to her chakra; she's a very pure fighter who uses chakra to boost her stats. If an extremely tired and exhausted Sakura has enough power to break goddess' horn and bruise the shit out of her face, she is of course very fast in her burst movements.

&gt;Her punching/cqc/attack speed is also absolutely insane.

&gt;Defense is debatable ig, depends on if you count 100 seals regeneration as part of it. I do agree Naruto has versatility/range, however.

Base Sakura is strong enough to bruise Kaguya and break her horn, while Madara’s rods are considered a threat to her (with Obito sending her out of the dimension) along with it later piercing right through her, and her also grunting as it’s pulled out.

She has no speed feats on Naruto’s level.

The main reason Sakura managed to punch her so quickly though was the fact that Kaguya was moving directly in her direction.

Naruto and Sasuke were also much closer to the center by the time the punch happened, with their arms lining up with Kaguya’s dress by this point.

&gt;She was also fast enough to react to (punch) Kaguya moving faster than Sasuke and Naruto. If she wasn't, then Kaguya would've just smacked into her rather than being punched.

Sakura was already in a punching position, and Naruto and Sasuke were both already in the air, with Sasuke’s only speed being whatever propulsion he jumped off the clone with. 

&gt;The speed at which Sakura moves her fist and throws punches is insane.

&gt;She has better AP. At the very least comparable stamina and chakra (1/2 of someone who can blitz and fuck up Kaguya). Fantastic attack speed feats, too.

Again, we don’t know what this 1/2 is even capable of, or if they can even fuck with Kaguya in the same fashion a Naruto with *two times as much power* did.

&gt;Naruto and Sasuke are moving towards middle point, Kaguya tries to escape upward and Fate Bros never stop moving towards middle point. Sakura manages to throw a punch at and send Kaguya back down before Naruto and Sasuke reach middle point.

Sakura sends Kaguya back down *because* she’s flying into Sakura’s direction.

&gt;I disagree on this. Context paints it as Sakura not noticing. Kishimoto explicitly draws her still and without !, until rod is closer.

Kishimoto still draws her still even when the rod is closer, it outsped her completely.

Context paints it as Obito/Sakura noticing/hearing Madara, and only Obito being fast enough to intercept. 

&gt;The author didn't present Sakura noticing anything even once. Using ""they must've heard it, so they notice faster than Madara attacked"" is also not something I agree with, as Naruto is a MASSIVELY hypersonic verse to begin with.

Kamui moves especially slowly, as scene with both Sasuke &amp; Kakashi noticing the portal and forming ! expressions before Sakura even gets out of it, and Madara gave them the benefit of *yelling* before he even threw it. 

So Sakura didn’t notice the:

&gt;Very slow Kamui

&gt;The sound associated with it

&gt;The dude literally yelling 

Until the rods (with an even smaller sound effect) were closing in on her?

Because KCM never fought Kaguya????

Kaguya was floating right into Sakura.

No, she threw a punch to an opponent moving *away* from Naruto and Sasuke and into her direction.

&gt;Yeah, that's just how it's presented in Manga. If Kishimoto wanted to show Sakura notice sooner, he'd show Sakura notice sooner. Instead, he makes Sakura notice when rods are closing in.

That’s hardly impressive, like…at all. You call it a very small headstart (????) but Sakura already had the target in place, was in position to punch, and was literally right in front of him. 

&gt;So is her punching and breaking Kaguya's horn and bruising her face while extremely exhausted.

Yeah pretty impressive. I just don’t like the part where you mentioned her punching Kaguya before Naruto &amp; Sasuke could reach her even though Kaguya was leaping directly into Sakura’s direction.

&gt;Thing is, I'm not saying those feats put her close to SPSM/Rinnegan. It's just far more impressive than anyone below KCM can dream of.

That’s not exactly saying much, especially for WA standards.

The broad themes of Naruto aren't even the problem necessarily its in the execution. Naruto himself is as boring as a plank of wood and he never actually responds to changes that give him much of an arc to mature. He is the same as he ever was, same ideas and it makes him come off as a know it all and unlikeable if you actually try to take him seriously.  


Also, for reference, people hated that crap Naruto did with Obito too, and Nagato, and pretty much anyone he used Talk no Jutsu on. Gaara and Naruto's connection is one of the few instances I'd consider something Naruto had that was legitimately a strong case to change someone's opinion since they're both jinchuriki. Him being made Kazekage is a bit of a stretch, but not beyond the suspension of disbelief since he still has a lot of vulnerabilities and Suna wasn't in much of a position to be picky.  


Hashirama forgiving Madara was also forced, not sure why you keep bringing up all of the largely agreed upon forced and ridiculous about faces the villains make. Honestly, it is just ham-fisted into the story to make Naruto appear correct.  


Same thing with Orochimaru and Kabuto, this is just becoming a repetitive slog of me repeating myself, so I'll just end it here. All the examples you gave are legitimately stupid immersion breaking things and I don't accept them because it boggles the mind how absurd they are in any shape or form.  


Sasuke is frankly just an easy target and favorite punching bag given Sakura has no dignity and Sasuke is a sociopathic monster. It's a pretty screwed up message you are putting out there that basically encourages women to adopt the ""I can fix him"" mentality and go full Stockholm Syndrome. Sasuke either should have never ended up with Sakura or been made less insane and pure evil especially in his behavior towards her.

Madara wanted true peace. Regardless of his methods and what he thought was just, you can’t deny that. Hashirama forgave him because he understood that more than anyone, that was his lifelong friend after all.

The problem myself and others have with Sakura forgiving Sasuke is because there is no reason for to besides that fact that she is blindly in love with the guy. There was no redemption or greater good in my eyes, especially at the end of the war arc when he was blatantly treating her like shit, and KILLED her in a genjutsu to knock her out right after she declared her undying love to him.

Naruto literally says he needs to “accept his punishment” during the talk no jutsu scene.

Orochimaru and Kabuto seem to have a deal where they can’t leave their assigned areas. Orochimaru is watched by Yamato 24/7 and Kabuto likely can’t do anything other than be the head of the orphanage 

I recommend checking out the Naruto Shippuden Blood Prison movie &amp; the Kakashi novel. That explains where rogue ninjas or high level criminal ninjas are sent to a specific Ninja jail in the Hidden Grass, the prison takes in ninja from every village. And yes this prison was canonized by Boruto and the Kakashi novel even if the movie itself isn’t really canon

The third isn't trash. He just never had good and trustable people around to support him, other than Minato, who died.

&gt;The Uzamaki Clan did die and get scattered in the 2nd Great War. Then even if the plot wasn’t as developed in Part 1 you’ll think there would be some mention of the Senju in Part 2 or Boruto.

How the fuck is Hiruzen responsible for the safety of other villages? Have you ever seen Naruto's geography? Uzushiogakure was miles away from Konoha

&gt;The Uchiha rebellion wasn’t an overnight think, It was after decades of mistreatment. You can’t blame the 2nd, who understandably didn’t like the Uchiha, he gave them positions of power.

I don't see how it's Hiruzen's problem, you can't force him to trust egotistical maniacs who get stronger when they get sad. Btw, Hiruzen was against the whole massacre thing and tried to solve it peacefully, but it was inevitable.

&gt;Fireball Jutsu maybe. However, the Reaper Death Seal is specific to the Uzamaki’s. It’s unlikely they’ll give up there clan's ultimate jutsu.

Lee would break his bones and tear his muscles, and not fix them beyond the healing factor given from the Gate of Healing (which I’m not entirely sure on the speed of it, since it basically is shown doing fuck all). While Lee is definitely stronger in my head, from a in universe explanation, Sakura is stronger.

Peripheral advantage is literally irrelevant.

&gt;Yes, ty for agreeing there was peripheral advantange. But it's not irrelevant.

That’s for *if* there were peripheral advantage.

&gt;It lets people know something is up immediately rather then delayed because stuff changes in their peripheral vision. Meanwhile others will notice slower because it's their blind spot, and they have to rely on other senses (proven by Sakura, who only noticed something was up later on due to her other senses rather than eyes, as you said).

Kamui has an entire sound dedicated to it, and Sakura made an ! expression, meaning she *did* notice Madara, yet wasn’t even able to begin turning around.

Vision literally doesn’t matter, it’s a matter of speed. Both Sakura *and* Obito already noticed Madara’s prescience, and Sakura couldn’t even *make* a move while Obito had enough time to look at Madara and Kamui her out of the dimension. While all of this was happening, Sakura was still staring directly at Obito, even though she noticed Madara prior to these panels. It’s not a matter of Madara being out of her vision or her not noticing him, as Kamui has a distinct sound and she makes an ! alert, but it’s a matter of Sakura not having the speed to react.

&gt;It's a literal scientific fact lol. This is how eyes work.

""Tsukuyomi is designed to be a potential one-shot genjutsu that can be used on the spur of the moment and in the heat of battle. Kotoamatsukami is the perfect jutsu for manipulation, assassination, or political takeovers.

In terms of battle usage, Tsukuyomi takes the edge. However, Kotoamatsukami comes out on top in sheer jutsu power. Take note that Kotoamatsukami doesn't place people under genjutsu, but rather outright manipulates their memories. Meaning that it cannot be detected by detecting a change in chakra flow on the target's body since the chakra flow will not change. Kotoamatsukami, when done with prior planning, has the potential to be the most powerful jutsu in the series and shines when put to use in the right situation.""",,uzumakiclan,False,False,[],False,{},,,False,False,True,t3_116jb06,,dark,True,/r/Naruto/comments/116jb06/in_your_personal_opinion_between_these_six_who_is/jal0rr2/,public,False,,[],1677731136,r/Naruto,0,,,,1677731156,1677731157,7fadb19ef4ea7d3d67903a29e378b0c8baf363c2,,2023-03-02 04:25:36,

The Susanoo yes for a non Uchiha needs both MS to use Susanoo which the Susanoo uses the Users chakra and creates a colour and characteristics based on there user.

If Obito used Susanoo before he died it would be a different colour and design and have characteristics to represent obito.

It’s not Obito’s Susanoo it’s Kakashi’s the susanoo was formed with its users chakra not Obito’s chakra who used Kaumi so kakashi could use DMS for a short time.

If Obito used susanoo before he died when he had DMS he would be using his own chakra to create it because the susanoo is created from the user’s character making it Kakashi’s.

You don’t see Madara’s being Izuna’s cause he has Izuna’s eyes or Sasuke’s being Itachi’s cause he has itachi’s eyes no cause it’s the users chakra.

Sure we can imagine it. Fanfics have done a great job in realizing those dreams. However the official anime narrative never gave her that space. Which sucks. Her one really cool fight was more about an old lady than her. 
Where is Sakuras power creep? If she’s supposed to be on the same level as the other two so where is it? 

What I’ve liked about Boruto (I haven’t seen all of it) is that she’s just cool and strong. She’s got her strengths and gets to be awsome just as she is. Not only as a sanin but as a mom and in running a villages entire hospital. A badass through and through. No more cowering. Do I wish we would have seen more of that journey, absolutely. 

That said I do love her early years. The seeds were definitely there just pushed aside for the other two. Sakura being the first one to climb the tree in the land of waves. Sakura pulling sasuke back from the brink in the forest of death. Being the only one to not need to cheat on the chunin exams. It’s all there but she is definitely more background than she should be. 

As to the fans. It’s hard to get a proper overview. I do think she’s always had loyal following. The dude bros were just louder.

Sasuke was directly in front of them. He was solely aiming for Madara, not focusing on saving Sakura, meaning he’d have to get even closer to land his hit. Sasuke not caring is emphasized on literally right after the exchange is over.

&gt;and Naruto was even further behind.

Naruto reaches them immediately after he jumps, aka when the panels actually start to focus on them. He went from being even further behind them &gt; close enough to grab Sakura with one leap.

Sakura was only trembling, not actually going through with the eye cutting, and also makes an ! expression, meaning she *did* notice. 

Kamui also makes a distinct “zwww” sound when entering and leaving the dimension, and in the next chapter you can see Sakura *still* looking at Obito by the time he does the Kamui to get her out, meaning while she did notice it, she was nowhere near fast enough to evade.

&gt;Also, I'm pretty sure she wasn't trying to dodge or react when she got stabbed. She activated 100 healing for a reason. She was to act as diversion.

Getting stabbed ≠ acting as a diversion. She could have dodged and (seemingly) leave an opening for Naruto &amp; Sasuke to attack.

&gt;Yup. And she doesn't try to throw a punch until after Fate bros start moving. And she throws it before they get to her.

Sasuke was directly in front of Madara by the time the hit connected, with Naruto catching up in the next panel the moment he jumps. 

&gt;And in final climax, an EXTREMELY exhausted Sakura bruises and breaks Kaguya's horn while throwing a punch faster than fate bros cover small distance.

Kaguya was leaping directly into Sakura’s direction, and Naruto &amp; Sasuke were doing the direct fighting and using energy much longer than her. 

&gt;Am I saying she's as fast as as Fate Bros? No. Is she keeping up and throwing punches before they can cover small distances? Yes. And that's a big deal.

Except Sasuke caught up, and Naruto also catches up immediately after the panels start focusing on them again.

&gt;Being over half of a Kaguya blitzing and maiming Naruto is big deal. If you think more than half of someone who can tear apart Kaguya's arm and blitz her doesn't equate to being above likes of KCM, hard disagree man.

This Naruto has little to no feats, along with his limits being unclear. All we know is that he wasn’t enough to supply Obito, which makes sense because Naruto was fighting Jubbidara &amp; Kaguya with barely any downtime for the past few chapters.",,uzumakiclan,False,False,[],False,{},,,False,False,True,t3_11chjao,,dark,True,/r/Naruto/comments/11chjao/i_need_help_coz_i_keep_getting_repeated/jakonej/,public,False,,[],1677725238,r/Naruto,0,,,,1677725257,1677725257,0906e387d44ab5062ec72255c3d408fa4474e2fc,,2023-03-02 02:47:18,

Kiba is faster, more wild and hard to predict in a fight.

Naruto wasn’t ping bad against Kiba when it was just a fist fight, but once Kiba started flying all over the place with Akamaru, attacking from multiple directions at high speeds, then it was different.

Hinata can only really attack Naruto in a straight forward kind of way.

Kiba was ranked 3.5 in speed at his base speed without enhancements.
Hinata was ranked a 2, the same as Naruto, meaning they are very close in relative speed.

Her stamina was only at a 1.5 while her Taijutsu at a 2.5.

So yes, she is better at hand to hand, but even an exhausted Naruto will severely outlast her.

She just doesn’t have the ability to overwhelm him.

The seal on Naruto by Orochimaru does not limit his chakra, the odd number seal placed on an even number seal fucked up his control of his chakra.

Hinata lacks the ability to see tenketsu and block chakra in battle at this point, so she can’t seal his chakra either.

Also you never answered my question. Is English your first language because you’ve already been wrong multiple times and I think it has to do with your misunderstanding of the English language. You literally said Sasuke told Naruto how he felt, but in the example you linked, Sasuke didn’t tell Naruto *anything* except what I said… which was that Naruto didn’t understand.

I had and really liked the idea that Sarada would get the MS without sasuke dying by killing Eida even though she was under her visual powers. It doubles down on the MS being obtained by the death of the person you care about most, and doubles down on the Uchiha ability to be dark enough to be the one to do the killing.

That’s not what racism is. Sasuke is a minority by definition, and I’m not discriminating him by race. You’re actually showing ignorance here man, stop.

You’re the one who decided to conflate the Uchiha to black people, dude.

Black were discriminated against based off of race.

The Uchiha were discriminated against because they weren’t good people.

Uchiha murdered Hashiramas younger brothers, 

And an Uchiha was literally responsible for the destruction of the village and death of the fourth Hokagae.

Comparing these two as if they are at all similar shows how ignorant YOU are.

&gt; But uh.. yeah? How many people did Kakashi murder? Same with Minato… he murdered how many people? This world is full of ninjas dude, most everyone is a murderer. Orochimaru ain’t a good guy by any means but it’s not like Sasuke was going towards him to fiddle children. Sasuke wanted power and as it turns out the real world works that way considering we barter with many countries that do/have done heinous things.

You are seriously excusing this.

What flawed logic, Kakashi was child soldier. He didn’t kill because he wanted to. Orochimaru killed for fun.

Apparently a serial killer and Soldier are the same thing to you.

&gt; And Asura and Indra is just a mcguffin dude. Don’t know how old you are but it’s not worth explaining. It’s a textbook example of bad writing what Naruto and no one with an IQ above single digits thinks this was a good addition.

It’s funny how you’re not only making seem like everyone agrees you , but also using the word Mcguffin wrong.

A Mcguffin is a story device used to facilitate the plot as well motivations for the characters.

Asura/Indura are not the Mcguffin. The very concept of human conflict is.

Asura and Indura add to that theme.

I keep noticing this with you. 

Whenever you win on a particular point, you strawman and go on a rant without ever actually explaining how or why the particular story concept doesn’t work for you.

You even tried to make up shit as to how Naruto’s reasoning for chasing Sasuke was something  he should’ve grown out of,

TLDR: Depends on what section of the Fandom you're talking about. Anime vs Manga, East vs West, Narrative vs Powerscalers, Male vs Female.

Generally speaking, she always got more hate from anime-only watchers than she did from manga readers. Theres a reason people grumble about Studio Perriot. Likewise, much like Sasuke, western fans were more critical of her than the Japanese Fandom. That isn't to say she isn't criticized by the JP Fandom, mind, but she's definitely more of a hot button with American fans.

Sakura is Useless memes were around in the 2000s, but in general the vibe once PII / Shippuden started was that she had her glow up. Opinions rose and fell, but the overall vibe was more positive as she got more feats under her belt.

(Though in general, support archetypes like her and Orihime got a lot more flak from powerscalers and ""dudebro"" shounen fans back in the day across the board )

But Fandom trends cycled back fairly recently. I wouldn't say Boruto has done much in either direction. She had fans, she has antis, she has people who like her character development and she has people who think x,y,z.

That said, I do think that because of the memes her haters in western Fandom seem a lot more VOCAL.

 But if you go by fan engagement (art, fic, popularity polls, merchandise sales) she definitely has a large and dedicated following.

You’re excusing Sasuke for teaming up with a known murder, a guy who literally finds it fun to experiment on human being for his immortality,

Is justifiable because fuck the leaf?

Not even going to acknowledge the frankly racist comparison there.

Asura and Indura make sense because throughout the series, you see many people just like Naruto and Sasuke. It also ties into the fact they we’re pretty much fated to fight.
But no, you wanna cherry-pick points you think you can win on.

&gt; And quote Sasuke. Quote what Sasuke said, because i rewatched the series and he just told Naruto that he didn’t understand… and he was right. But I keep asking you to post receipts and you haven’t posted ONE.


[he says it right here.](https://official-complete-2.eorzea.us/manga/Naruto/0229-010.png)

Do characters need to frankly just tell you everything about their feelings outright, it’s pretty obvious from the framing here he’s broken about it.

&gt; Also, Naruto did nothing with that information. At all. He just called Obito a cool guy. That’s like me saying kid Hitler was a cool guy… it’s irrelevant compared to the atrocities he did but keep slurping harder man lol

Ok wow.

Hagoromo inherited Kaguya's yang energy while Hamura inherited her yin energy. We can see how that plays out by looking at Indra and Asura or Naruto and Sasuke. Hamura would have been a talented genius growing up with Hagoromo not able to match his brother's strength until he trained for years to develop a power that matched Hamura's raw talent.

Since Hagoromo inherited Kaguya's yang energy, his descendants that got his yang energy are stronger than his yin descendants. Which is why Asura&gt;Indra and Senju&gt;Uchiha.

For Hamura's descendants, the story doesn't seem to add up to what we'd expect. His yin descendants should be stronger than his yang descendants. So, the Hyuuga, who got his eyes, should be stronger than the Otsutsuki on the moon, who inherited his body. 

Worse than that, this all indicates that the Hyuuga should also be stronger than the Uchiha and basically equivalent to the Senju in overall power. 

Nothing in the story demonstrates this to us. The Hyuuga should be at the pinnacle of the ninja world now that the Senju aren't around and yet we get nothing. Not even any kind of nod to their true power level or capabilities. 

There's small hints about their power. Like how Sasuke Retrieval Arc Neji got back up and kept fighting with worse injuries than what Sasuke was about to die from after Madara stabbed him in War Arc.

The strategy is protection and healing for Random Aburame and Bee while they whittle away at Susanoo’s before sending in bodies to do other things, like the maybe Hyuga thing.

2. for Sarada, I really don't think it was ever writen with the intent to make it be because of the memories of years of neglect from her father. She has whole-ass conversations with Sakura about that, and no Sharingan. It was out of the exciment to see Sasuke, but I never really paid that much attention to Boruto, so if someone with more knowledge can correct me, please do.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;It‘s this strong love that the Uchiha feel that makes the loss so much more painful.

Okay, well, that proves what I was saying, that Tobirama is wrong. Obito didn't lose anyone, if anything he gained a friend (in Kakashi, because he realized Kakashi came back for him&amp;Rin), and Sarada was as far from losing anything as possible. It was the oposite. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;It‘s this intensity resulting from feeling emotions that strongly that makes them suffer so much and activates the sharingan.

Just to be sure we're on the same page regarding Tobirama's theory: Tobirama says that when an Uchiha experiences the despair and anguish created by loss of love, a special chakra is released in their brain, that interacts with the optic nerve and that interaction results in the Sharingan. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;And that in my opinion is the curse that Tobirama‘s talking about. 

Contrary to popular belief, he never said anything about any curse.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;So if your Uchiha friend tells you they awakened their sharingan consider giving them a hug. They probably need it. (Big Hug if it‘s MS)
