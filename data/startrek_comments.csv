So, ship on lockdown, Romulans on the way,  a disease onboard, a dead Romulan ship in tow with the ships first officer aboard dying. Realizing that housing in the Briar Patch isn't a long term solution,  Harriman orders Commander T'Sara to locate and disconnect the *Tomed's* Cloaking Device and for it to be beamed to Main Engineering, intending to use it to evade the Romulans, only for Com. T'Sara to find that it's already been removed. More exhaustive examination of the *Tomed* by T'Sara reveals that the ships main computer has been purged of all but the most basic functions, the weapons have been stripped out, and the ships atmospherics have been modified to disperse low levels of a preservative agent, the crew actually having been dead for several days by the time *Enterprise* intercepted her.  The ship,  it seems,  was a plant.

Harriman realizes that the Romulans must have found themselves, through accident or design, with a ship with a dead crew, and decided to put it to use, firstly sending it across the Neutral Zone, hopefully Starfleet destroys it, then they could reveal the crew was dead and therefore destroying it was unprovoked, painting Starfleet as the aggressors. Secondly, if he intercepted it but didn't destroy it, as was now the case, if they destroy *Enterprise*, they could claim to be rescuing the *Tomed*, replace the crew,  claim the *Tomed* crossed the Neutral Zone due to something like a navigational error, and *still* portray Starfleet as the aggressors.

The CMO calls up to the Bridge again.  They've got the first casualty,  two members of the away team have suffered cardiac arrest due to cellular apoptosis triggered by the viral infection brought back from the *Tomed*. It appears in humans the disease is lethal in less than 12 hours. She says crewman have reported symptoms on decks 3 through 9, 12 through 18, and 21 through 29. Fortunately no no-one on the bridge appears to be infected. She reports that the virus sends to have a unique protein structure which she's having trouble analyzing,  but that a Starbase medical facility may have the proper equipment to yield results, the nearest one being Deep Space Three, six hours away. 

Now he's got his own *Kobayashi Maru*, if he waits for Starfleet, a significant portion of his crew won't live long enough. If he exits the Briar Patch to try and make it to the nearest Starbase with medical facilities, there's 4 Romulan Warbirds waiting to destroy them.

He comes up with a plan,  and contacts Com. T'Sara aboard the *Tomed*.

The warbirds have taken up positions outside the Briar Patch, directly between it and Starbase Three. Suddenly, sensors indicate a vessel emerging, they arm weapons and prepare to fire, but what emerges is the *Tomed* on an intercept course. The Romulan Commander orders the group to hold fire as he wonders if maybe some of the crew survived.  As the *Tomed* approaches them, far behind,  the *Enterprise* emerged from the Briar Patch, they maneuver around the *Tomed* to get clear lines of fire on the *Enterprise-B*, when suddenly there's an energy spike from the *Tomed*, just before it explodes,  it's singularity drive losing containment, destroying 3 of the warbirds and disabling the last moments before the Enterprise-B flies past and goes to warp.

In Sick Bay aboard the Enterprise, Com. T'Sara calls up to the Bridge to report she's aboard. The CMO points out she could've beamed aboard earlier,  once she's discovered that the virus came aboard from the rest of the away team leaving her on the *Tomed* only delayed her getting proper treatment. But Com. T'Sara protests, she was needed to prepare the *Tomed* to operate under her own power and take commands from the *Enterprise* computer.

Anyway,  I figure that's the pilot. The next few episodes would be Starfleet begrudgingly allowing the Enterprise to hold position just outside transporter range of Starbase Three, not allowing anybody on or off the ship, failing to find a cure for the virus,  the eventual death of everyone on the infected decks,  and then eventually allowing those on uninfected decks to beam off, be screened, evaluated, given counseling, and transferred. Meanwhile Captain Saavik and the *Titan* are heading up negotiations with the Romulans, who are blaming the whole thing on a misunderstanding,  claiming a garbled distress call from the *Tomed* had been misinterpreted to indicate Starfleet aggression, when it was actually a warning not to board due to the infection. A misconstruction due to a difference between the Captain's dialect of Romulan and the receiving officers, supposedly.

Meanwhile the Enterprise-B is officially listed as inactive, pending investigation into possible decontamination, or, if that's not feasible,  destruction.

Captain Harriman gets debreifed. There's a formal hearing. Under his command the ship may as well have been lost,  more than 400 crew dead, an interstellar incident with the Romulans... None of the Starfleet brass really blame him or believes he did anything wrong,  but it's procedure. He's cleared off any wrongdoing and commended for his quick thinking.

Things come to a head with the Romulans, they are now claiming that the virus that killed the crew of the *Tomed*, that killed most of the crew of the *Enterprise-B*, was an engineered weapon, and furthermore they're claiming it was engineered by a Vulcan scientist,  and a former member of Starfleet. To determine the truth, Harriman is assigned to find him.

You've hit on something brilliant with the idea of a workhorse planet-of-the-week series (I see room for two) and then essentially a miniseries or two a year (give me two great 6-episode arcs any day). A lot of my complaints would go away with the serialized stories if they were all intended (and written) to be self contained instead of being sold as an ongoing story. Hell, Disco *is* that in everything but marketing.

With successful ongoing TV, a multiseason arc needs to be the basis. It's readily apparent when people had no idea what to do with season 2, and that happens way too often across streaming. Look how Tiger King did, and it was supposed to be a one-and-done. Paramount doing a couple of those a year could be huge without the long-term contracts, and they'd always be free to return to something if they had a reason to.

I think it was the '80s (might have bled into the early '90s) when the Perry Mason primetime specials aired. They just seemed to randomly pop up, and they were quite popular.

First, their ability to juggle massive amounts of hyper-detailed contract content as a matter of course suggests that, whether due to a biological or artificial advantage, their cognitive capabilities vastly outstrip those of the more human-like races seen on the show. That alone would make them a pretty terrifying foe in direct combat.

Second, we know they consider races on our ""level"" to be little more than vermin with the ability to communicate, and find it essentially undignified to even have to speak with us, the way we'd probably feel pretty embarrassed if we somehow got into a legal dispute with an ant hill. In any other context this might be dismissed as mere arrogance or even bigotry. But the Sheliak are objective to a fault—their communication is utterly emotionless, and despite their aggression, their entire colonization strategy is halted the moment Picard spots a valid loophole—suggesting they value clear-eyed analysis so fundamentally that even their own societal ambitions take a back seat.

* Star Trek and trying to evade a heavily-armed vengeance-filled enemy in a nebula. Name a more iconic duo, I'll wait.

* The deaging there was rough, but I loved the scene there. 

* A great performance by Frakes, too.

* Jeez, they couldn't give the watchpeople binoculars or something?

* The tradition of classical music continues.

* ""This feels rehearsed.""

* Beverly, back at it in sickbay like she never even left!

* Ah, don't you hate it when you can't tell your lover that you're pregnant because people keep trying to kill him?

* This whole ""Beverly and Jean-Luc had a kid"" plotline could have been utterly horrible, but they are doing it very well.

* Okay, so I guess Wesley is too busy flitting about the timestream as a Traveler to get in touch with his mom.

* Riker is enjoying this sooo much. 

* THEY ACTUALLY EXPLAINED THE ACCENT!

* Bearing 0**47**! 

* Interesting how Shaw gives command to Riker, not Picard. 

* ""I think it might be time you called me Number One.""

* Worf remains the best. Also, he made tea. 

* I'm glad Jack is being shown to be a medic instead of just the muscle/rogue for Beverly.

* Shit, Vadic is thinking with portals.

* ""Beheadings are on Wednesdays.""

* Glad they actually are giving Seven stuff to do this week.

* Man, Jack had a helluva trip.

* Now J-LP gets to take that long turbolift ride.

* OH SHIT, CHANGELING!

* Odo! If only Rene were around for this...

* That move with the portal sending the torpedos right into the Titan's ass was one hell of an OH SHIT moment.

Her xenophobia toward Data is inexcusable, and not defensible, so I'm setting that aside. _Other_ than that, she is simply an experienced, senior doctor who has her own grip on things and talks pretty straight.

I think she was written to be in the mold of grouchy ol' McCoy, but of course in a sexist society men can get away with many behaviors that women can't. Pulaski is as warm and good-willed as McCoy, and it does come out occasionally if you're looking for it.

I think how we see the doctors of Star Trek says something about ourselves. When I was a kid, Bashir was my favorite doctor by far, because I related to him at the time, but these days I see him as an insufferable jerk for much of the first half of the series—or, more charitably, just very very young and inexperienced and self-centered—and kind of a macabre wet blanket the second half of the series.

Pulaski meanwhile (other than the bigotry) is a heavyweight. She is a credible counterbalance to Picard (in a way that Riker never was), and you definitely get the sense that she knows what she is doing as a doctor (in a way that doesn't really land for, say, Bashir or Phlox or Voyager's holographic The Doctor.) She's up there with McCoy in gravitas.

But after reflection, it makes sense. Riker's not that person anymore. He's been deeply impacted by the death of Thaddeus.  There's been enough this season to establish this in his character, it's not just a throwaway. I also wondered why he didn't have a moment with his old Captain's chair, in his first command. But maybe he doesn't want it - that's how fearful he's become. (This makes more sense if we just ignore the Picard S1 finale.)

So I think this moment works, but I sure hope it gets paid off again later this season, and we can get a glimpse of his old self. The Best of Both Worlds was peak Riker as much as it was peak Trek. I can't accept  Riker being outcaptained by some outlaw in an Elachi garbage scow.

Prior to the late 80s, nobody knew or gave a shit about climate change. Shows like Dinosaurs and other media (not to mention scientists) have gradually increased the presence of the dangers of global warming in public consciousness. A TV show was never going to change everyone's mind dramatically, but it probably played a small part.

The other thing is, [humanity is actually making progress on climate change](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/10/26/magazine/climate-change-warming-world.html). No, it's not enough to avert major impacts, but we have probably averted a apocalyptic future where civilization and even humanity ceases to exist because of climate change. That doesn't mean the future is going to be rosy, but we still have a chance to make a difference.

I highly recommend the above article, because it isn't naive or shy away from the steep challenges we face, but it also doesn't engage in doomerism. I especially like this quote from environmental and feminist writer Rebecca Solnit:

&gt;We live in an unimaginable future. Things thought impossible or inconceivable or unlikely not very long ago are accepted norms now. A lot of my hope is just radical uncertainty.

The sudden dark shift in tone was startling and frankly counterproductive to what I had generally liked about Trek. DS9 did this better with a slow build. 

The Expanse itself was an incredibly awkward concept. It was cool but we ultimately know it’s a temporary and artificial thing because this show is a prequel that takes place relatively close to Earth. 

The Xindi had a ton of promise, but it’s ultimately unrealized because we end up watching their machinations from the very beginning. So we got alien politics but no actual Earth politics after an utterly seismic shift in Earth’s status quo. A massive missed opportunity. 

But again, prequel status rears up. How is it possible that the Xindi attack on Earth has never been brought up. The Xindi have never been referenced. Much less seen. 

This societal structure would actually have been relevant in previous series episodes like City in the Edge of Forever. 

Tying it into the Temporal Cold War was annoying too. That entire thing bugged me. To such a degree that I questioned whether I was watching a prequel or the begining of a massive retcon. 

This attack could have been carried out by Nausicans or better yet Romulans with a long wind up to the eventual Earth/Romulan war. 

Season 4 however is incredible. 

Another note, I think they had painted themselves into a corner with the characterizations of their original crew.

We also know that Denise Crosby was let out of her contract on request, and Gates McFadden, and Wil Wheaton, so it's also possible there was concern Patrick Stewart didn't WANT to continue, and thus, it's possible he might have chosen to leave, regardless of contract. It's also possible that even though he had a contract, he was planning to (or they thought he might) threaten to leave if they didn't re-negotiate and pay him more now that the show was successful.",,,False,False,[],False,{},,,False,False,True,t3_11gg9ri,,,True,/r/startrek/comments/11gg9ri/star_trek_discovery_to_end_with_season_5/jap0nvk/,public,False,,[],1677803851,r/startrek,0,,,,1677803866,1677803866,569c57c5a09ebbb14e3b1d30216c7d6eadff8889,,2023-03-03 00:37:31,

Since Deanna is an empath, Matalas wanted to explore how they'd all deal with the intensity of grief, stating that ""Nepenthe"" made it look like they were overcompensating for it. 

The Popcast Unleashed YT channel is run by two guys who've seen the entire season, and they (along with Robert Meyer Burnett) said we find out that Riker left Nepenthe because he couldn't deal with the emotions of his grief - which would mean he's been replaced later on. Riker also mentions ""missing"" Starfleet in the shuttle with Picard, which seems genuine. His facial expressions in episode one when talking to Picard about Beverly in the bunk beds seemed genuine. 

I'd just hate if all we've seen (and loved) of Riker so far is all a lie. We'll have missed out on several episodes with the real Riker and only get the real one in the back half of the season.

Whenever characters like Janeway or Picard talked about their past ships and their academy days I always got curious what that was like. Being a cadet and then a young officer and going from ship to ship and rising through the ranks. 

I would love for the group to come from different species and planets and the pilot episode shows how each character ended up applying to starfleet academy. 

And then we follow them through the years and see their growth and development as people and starfleet officers.  We can focus on each character with episodic stories while still threading throughout the seasons the story line of their relationships and dynamics with one another. Like are they all still keeping in touch? Keeping in touch with college friends can be tough nowadays but I wonder how star trek technology could affect that. 

There's lots of potential for interesting character dynamics if the group ends up reunited on the same ship years later. Have some of them drifted apart? Is there tension or jealousy if one of them was promoted to captain first? Or any romantic tension between members of the group?

Since they were discussing going to the institute in this episode I would expect them to get there either in episode 5 or 6, which would make the real Riker appear in at least 5 episodes.

If they just needed an excuse for Riker to be alone with Picard for a while they could have put him on Earth for a conference or something.  The only reason they would have him having issues at home is if it’s necessary to the story.  So he’s either caused problems intentionally to cover being a Changeling, or the writers put it in as a ham fisted red herring.

&gt; See?  That's what you sound like if this were a forum talking about TOS and Uhura back in the 60s.

But….my point is the same then as in now. Uhuru wasn’t shoehorned. Sulu wasn’t shoehorned. There weren’t broad story arcs around Uhuru being  Black or Sulu being Japanese. Their identity was, again, secondary to the mission. 

I don’t think you get my meaning despite my effort to be really clear. It’s great to have underrepresented groups in media - I explicitly said that and repeat it - but it’s not compelling production to decide “we have to have a gay character so we can tell a gay story or really make him exploring his gayness the entire story arc.” It’s better to be like “we are casting this character as gay” and let the storytelling continue to center on what Trek has focused on forever, where the identity of an individual continues to be incidental to the story and the crew, becoming relevant when it is relevant (eg a love interest storyline, etc).",,,False,False,[],False,{},,,False,True,True,t3_11gg9ri,,,True,/r/startrek/comments/11gg9ri/star_trek_discovery_to_end_with_season_5/jaosxgq/,public,False,,[],1677800430,r/startrek,0,,,,1677800448,1677800449,e317696d7daac2807b4796e1465989e63f92df75,,2023-03-02 23:40:30,

I posted here earlier that I felt Discovery had new places to go, lots more stories to tell and a whole lot of world building to do. But it's understandable in this day and age that as shows get more seasons and casts stay the same, those costs continue to tick upwards. The streaming revolution is both a blessing and a curse in that respect, because shows now end up hitting a certain point and then get axed because their freshness seems to be deemed *""poor""*.

Really the big reason I was thinking it would come to an end is that it's kind of served its purpose? And frankly the story didn't need to linger much longer. Burnham, Saru, Stamets, Tilly, Culber, all have developed into more or less the version of themselves that they needed to be. 

Mike is much better at reaching out to others and forming connections and consensus, as opposed to the person she was when she pulled a mutiny. Saru is no longer a coward who submits, but a brave and resolute leader who leads sternly but compassionately. Stamets chilly demeanor has warmed as he forms a family with his reunited love and pseudo-adopted kid Adira. Culber has learned to turn his trauma into a source of aid for others. Tilly found a direction for herself that she couldn't even have imagined when the show started.

Really there isn't much more to do with this thing other than maybe give some more substance to the bridge crew. Otherwise we may as well have had our series finale *last* season.

I'd love to see more of the 32nd Century, but it doesn't need to be on this ship. And while I respect the role this show played in establishing the contemporary era of Trek (Disco walked so SNW could run! I'll repeat that to the heavens!) it's no longer needed to be the flagship. The franchise has other opportunities; More SNW, a Picard spinoff, ANOTHER Discovery spinoff, maybe a new one in the 32nd! I'm sure they're feeling the pinch between what they WANT to make and this show that's becoming an albatross. Paramount isn't made of THAT much money.

It's time. It's just time for it to come to a close.

No, they don't. At least not cast's. Actors most commonly have a fixed contract for the same amount of money until the contract expires before they have to renegotiate and yes, at that point rates generally go up unless you are an expendable cast member. 

TNG actors reportedly had 6-year contracts. Particularly in the 90s, those contracts generally would have been a fixed amount per episode, not increasing per season. When the contracts ran out, they reportedly signed new two-year contracts which certainly would have been for higher amounts than the previous season.

&gt;One of the reasons TNG ended at season 7 was actor (or as we say, ""talent"") cost.

This at least is true. As noted, the cast was actually contracted for an 8th year, but because of the new contract, the profitability of the show would have been lower, and they were able to instead put the same lower resources to start Voyager with a new (cheaper) cast. If they had been ready to run a new show so soon after DS9, I suspect they might not have even run a 7th TNG season with new contracts.

I haven't seen/can't find any reports on how long Disco's main cast were initially contracted for, so there is no basis to assume that season 6 was going to be a 'contract year'. It's possible, but it's also possible that the powers that be have seen that Disco clearly has a very tumultuous reputation and if there are going to be cuts (Picard also being of poor reception for the first two seasons, and already announced to be having a planned ending this season), it makes sense for the cut to be Disco over the seemingly better-received Lower Decks or SNW.

It's sad to learn that season five will be our final one. It was an especially gratifying season for me, as I was promoted to being a full writer on the show and given the opportunity to write a second episode. Discovery will always hold a special place in my heart, and not only because it gave me professional opportunities never before realized. Star Trek has meant so much to me through my life; I know I am not unique in finding encouragement and comfort in its stories of acceptance and progressivism, but it speaks to the universal truths of its storytelling that my experience is common across the fanbase.

I remember being in second grade, constantly drawing the Enterprise (refit, because I was in love with the TOS movies and because the Ent-D was hard to draw.) It would usually be set against vivid backgrounds of color, inspired by the Nexus in Generations (which had just come out) or the explosion of Praxis in The Undiscovered Country. Sometimes I have to stop and remind myself that I'm fortunate to tell stories in this universe I love so dearly.

I'm so incredibly proud to have been a part of this era, this franchise, and this series. Laying the foundation for tales in the 32nd century has been exciting, but truly my greatest pride is in the boundaries pushed in regards to representation. Star Trek is for everyone, and if Discovery made new fans feel accepted in a way they hadn't, then I consider it a great success.

I hope you all enjoy our final season when it airs next year. It's a fun one!

For me, it's very easy to watch TNG every now and again. Perhaps that's the strength of so many stand alone episodes. Its very easy to drop in during any season and hear the soothing sounds of the ship while they talk in the observation lounge about whatever problem they are facing. 

With DS9, the downside of massive series spanning arcs is you can't really do that, you have to start for the beginning. And so for me its a big ask to start it all over again. Now every TV series is like that which I actually think is a bit of a shame. If anything, if it's going to be a huge arc it should be short and sweet, like the queens gambit. 6 Episodes is more then enough to tell a good story.

Anyway, I certainly recommend HIGHLY that you watch TNG, for it is truly amazing. Look up some ""watch lists"" as the first season is quite a chore to get through, but season 2 has some of the highest highs but also the lowest lows. 

as for season 3,4,5,6,7 Its starts becoming more of ""its totally worth watching 20/22 episodes."" It's all very well written and thought provoke.

It's sad to learn that season five will be our final one. It was an especially gratifying season for me, as I was promoted to being a full writer on the show and given the opportunity to write a second episode. *Discovery* will always hold a special place in my heart, and not only because it gave me professional opportunities never before realized. *Star Trek* has meant so much to me through my life; I know I am not unique in finding encouragement and comfort in its stories of acceptance and progressivism, but it speaks to the universal truths of its storytelling that my experience is common across the fanbase. 

I remember being in second grade, constantly drawing the Enterprise (refit, because I was in love with the TOS movies and because the Ent-D was hard to draw.) It would usually be set against vivid backgrounds of color, inspired by the Nexus in *Generations* (which had just come out) or the explosion of Praxis in *The Undiscovered Country*. Sometimes I have to stop and remind myself that I'm fortunate to tell stories in this universe I love so dearly.

I'm so incredibly proud to have been a part of this era, this franchise, and this series. Laying the foundation for tales in the 32nd century has been exciting, but truly my greatest pride is in the boundaries pushed in regards to representation. *Star Trek* is for everyone, and if *Discovery* made new fans feel accepted in a way they hadn't, then I consider it a great success.

I hope you all enjoy our final season when it airs next year. It's a fun one! 

Live long and prosper,

FADE IN:

EXT. VULCAN PLANET - DAY

Mike Rowe stands on a rocky terrain, wearing his signature work clothes and a bemused expression. He looks around as he's greeted by T'Pol, a Vulcan scientist.

T'POL:
Welcome to Vulcan. I am T'Pol, and I have been assigned to work with you today.

MIKE:
(grinning)
Well, this looks like a job I'm sure I've never done before.

T'POL:
(smiling slightly)
Our team is studying the planet's geology. We have several tasks that require assistance, and we thought you might be interested in participating.

MIKE:
(excitedly)
Absolutely! Let's get started.

T'Pol leads Mike to a nearby cave. The cave is dark and damp, and Mike can barely see anything in front of him.

T'POL:
(handling Mike a laser drill)
We need to drill into the rock to collect some samples. But we must be careful not to damage the cave's ecosystem.

Mike takes the laser drill and starts cutting into the rock. He's surprised by how quickly the laser cuts through the rock.

MIKE:
(wiping his forehead)
This is pretty intense. How do you guys do this every day?

T'POL:
(stoically)
We are a patient people. We approach our work with logic and reason.

As they work, T'Pol shows Mike how to take measurements of the rock's properties. She explains that their research is focused on the planet's seismic activity, and they're looking for signs of potential earthquakes.

MIKE:
(fascinated)
Wow, this is really important work. You guys are the real deal.

T'POL:
(nodding)
We take our research very seriously. It is critical to our understanding of the planet's geology and to predict any potential disasters.

As the day comes to a close, T'Pol invites Mike to join her team for dinner.

INT. CAMP - NIGHT

T'Pol, Mike, and the Vulcan team sit around a small fire, roasting some food.

T'POL:
(to Mike)
I hope the work was satisfactory.

MIKE:
(smiling)
Oh yeah, it was a great experience. I learned a lot.

One of the Vulcan team members speaks up.

VULCAN TEAM MEMBER:
(to Mike)
We were impressed with your handling of the laser drill. You even found a hidden vein of minerals that T'Pol had missed.

MIKE:
(grinning)
Yeah, I have a knack for this kind of thing.

The group continues to converse about the importance of their work and the Vulcan philosophy of logic and reason.

T'POL:
(to Mike)
I believe you have learned much about our culture today.

MIKE:
(nodding)
Absolutely. I've gained a new appreciation for the importance of scientific research and the value of patience.

As he heads back to the transporter pad to return to his own world, Mike feels grateful for the opportunity to work with the Vulcans. He's learned a lot about their culture and their commitment to scientific research, and he's excited to take those lessons with him as he continues his adventures in space.

Unfortunately, I think a lot of film people approach it that way, like “oh let’s make this character be gay” and then predicate storylines about the character’s gayness. Sometimes it works (see The Last of Us episode 3), but many times it is off-putting. 

I think a lot of people bristle at that. Like it’s one thing if you’re watching Moonlight, where sexuality is critical to the narrative and themes, but this is a franchise about exploring all the crazy shit in the universe. Anyone being straight or gay or trans or Black or white or whatever identity, as a character, is secondary to the broader story. 

I also have to imagine in 500+ years being gay or trans or whatever will just be another unremarkable personal attribute like the color of one’s hair or eyes. You can probably safely assume that there are plenty of gay and trans people on the ship in SNW, it’s just not something people have to remark on or predicate their stories on (although again, there are ways to do such stories right).

Perhaps we're seeing some clearing of the decks and Matalas will get the go ahead to spin something(s) off of Picard. Hell, maybe they are making room for a Titan series ***and*** a Worf/Raffi Section 31 series.

If you look back to the heyday of Trek when DS9 was in production, we were getting 52 episodes of Trek per year. Four shows of 10 to 13 episodes per season put us at about that amount (Yes. LD is only 30 minutes, so we get less).

I think maybe they want to focus Trek back on the 23rd to 25th century and just let the two seasons of Discovery that were in the far future so as to not create way too much ""future canon"". Also, if they are smart they need to find money to fund a Matalas project or two, so turfing Discovery makes sense.

Basically the premise of the late 2000's Syfy show Eureka - whacky science city that is top secret, and there's always something goofy, weird stuff happening. [They can't even do a bank robbery normally](https://youtu.be/AKYPNco2U2Y).

Except of course it's in Trek universe, sometime in the late 2300s, or early 2400s. The only problem I see is that Eureka was specifically written in a manner that shows off how whacky science thingamajigs need to be combined with good old fashioned human intuition and reliance on well-known forensics and law enforcement procedure, to resolve the situations - which is hard to achieve in an already futuristic settings, since the ""good old fashioned"" part would also be sci-fi.

Nonetheless I would love to see a light-hearted, family Trek show that is episodic, set in a somewhat limited setting, and revolves around science going wrong.

Second--you are misreading every character beat. Riker's motivation for keeping the ship safe and not engaging the Shrike is EXPLAINED IN THE TITLE. It's RIGHT THERE. He does not want to put people he cares about in jeopardy because the experience of becoming a parent and then losing his child made him acutely aware of mortality. This is ALSO why he's so pissed at Picard for being so cavalier about it. ALSO we have never seen this dynamic--dueling captains--before so it's weird to complain that either is acting out of character. Prior to ""Picard"" we've only ever seen Riker in command in Picard's absence. The show is challenging what we're familiar with by upending the power dynamics of that relationship.

There were two known examples of humans trying to transfer their consciousness into Androids: the TOS ""What little girls are made of"" and Ira Graves hijacking Data's body. Both times ended badly. Data's attempt to build a new Soong type android failed, and Maddox's synths working on Mars were (supposedly) not capable of full sentience. Then the Synth ban came into place that would have prevented it.   


It's important to note that during the events of Ship in a Bottle Moriarty did questionable and criminal things, showing he had no compunction about killing over a thousand people, including civilians and children, to get his way. He demonstrated himself to be a clear danger and highly intelligent. 

Even with the Synth ban lifted we don't know if Alton Soong's synths are compatible hosts for a holomatrix. They don't even appear to be compatible with Data's positronic brain, even though he was the progenitor of the species. Alton left Data running in a sim instead of giving him a new Synth body.

The Golem was specifically designed to receive a human mind, and we know from Discovery that Soong never got it to work reliably after giving the first one to Picard. 

Add all of that to the fact that 30 years have passed during which Moriarty has (we presume) believed that he has been living a life and living a life growing old with the Countess. To be pulled out of that and told ""hey, yeah, that was all another lie, your entire existence has been a fraud, and even though the last time you were able to interact with the real world yu hijacked a starship and were going to kill everyone you possibly could, here's a new body for you.

* Does Tuvix *deserve* to die? I think *obviously* not.
* Should the crew have stood up for him? No. The senior staff clearly had a well rounded discussion and fully considered the moral implications of the choice

The bigger issue, as I see it, is not whether he deserved to die but rather: did he have a right to the personhood of Tuvok and Neelix? And I think the answer is a hard, no. It doesn't matter if Tuvix didn't deserve to die. He didn't have a right to take nonconsensually Tuvok and Neelix's existences away simply to live - unintentionally or not.

This may be controversial but, I think Tuvix was a very well done and subtle commentary on abortion. And how the possibility of a beautiful and innocent baby (Tuvix) ultimately can't revoke the independent bodily autonomy of its mother (Tuvok and Neelix) - and that's true even if the baby (Tuvix) is innocent (which it is).

I think if the crew had found a way to restore Tuvok and Neelix while letting Tuvix live then that would have been the solution. And, I think that reflects how we think about abortion in American law too. If a fetus can survive outside the womb (even with extreme medical intervention) then that's what we require.

Not only is Picard badly compromised emotionally, but it's likely been decades since he directly commanded a starship.    Not only is he rusty, but he's also unfamiliar with the technological advances on the Titan.

Riker may be loyal to Picard on both a personal and professional level, but he's also much more objective and we see that his decision to hide is the best answer right now since the Titan is not only massively outgunned, but is also dealing with technology it's never seen before.

When Riker does take Picard's advice, it backfires horribly.

This is some damn good writing because it shows that while Picard is a legend that has saved the Federation and galaxy countless times, he's also an elderly man whose experience has gradually wasted away.

He's even lost his greatest advantage and that is his emotional detachment as a commander.

They're going to test it before it's used in battle, at which point any holes can be plugged. Vadic doesn't seem like the type that would allow a weapon to be used during battle with such an obvious flaw. Given its strategic value, and the fact it's one of a kind, they'd likely avoid using it if it was so fragile. It's not like that ship is short on alternate weapons it can use.  

Ultimately what determines how the weapon works is the writers. They're trying to create an exciting story rather than a physics lesson, so entertainment gets prioritized over scientific accuracy. The writers will never paint themselves in a corner in that manner. They'll just create a new bit of technobabble to explain why it doesn't interfere with any of the ship's systems if it comes to that. Star Trek is no stranger to that one weird trick. Given how anti-climactic it would be for this awesome new weapon to be disabled so easily, I don't agree there was ever a chance it could be disabled as easily as you suggest. 

It will be used to defeat Vadik involving a heroic moment for Geordi, and an obscure theory he creates on the spot. It will of course involve charging the deflector with exotic particles we've never heard of before, and reversing the polarity of something. The word subspace will probably be important too. There will be a moment where Geordi propose the plan and says it has a 1% chance of working when asked for the probability of success. Maybe it won't work at first and there's a tense moment where Geordi tries to figure out why and has to implement a quick fix. But in the end it will work and the enemy will be heroically defeated not by brute force, but by the technical skill and ingenuity of Geordi LaForge.

Wellllll, VOY has both Neelix and the EMH.

Having said that:

&gt;Anyone Find It Ironic That The ""Darkest"" Trek Series (DS9) Also Has By Far The Most Comedic Relief?

Maybe ""ironic"" is the right word, but, I don't think that's a coincidence. There are some very dark moments in the series, and the comedy helps humanize\* them. This is perhaps most obviously the case with Vic Fontaine.

To give another example from TNG, take ""Family"". After the very dark TBoBW two-parter comes an episode that's in one way light-hearted and in another way Picard beginning to process his trauma.

And even the Ferengi… sure, the Ferengi-focused episodes _themselves_ tend to be slapstick comedies. But the characters are actually much deeper than that. Quark is ostensibly a petty criminal but actually has heart, and occasionally surprised with deep analysis of Federation hypocrisy. Rom, as his kid points out, is a tragic figure in that he's highly skilled but never put his career first, yet _also_ managed to screw up his love life. Nog, finally, doesn't want to repeat what he considers his dad's mistakes, and pushes forward by joining Starfleet, only to be met with the realities of war. Who once seemed to be a dumb kid who only existed for comic relief becomes a war veteran who loses a leg.

We also have the Picard show context which is, once again, that she did _try_ to tell him multiple times (3 if I recall) and gave up on trying to tell him because every time she reached out, she was informed that he was in another life threatening situation.

A strong point last week was Will and Jean-Luc’s camaraderie. Seeing them go from that to yelling at each other in this episode just seemed contrived.

“You’d burn everything to protect them” doesn’t seem Starfleet to me and doesn’t seem like something Will would say. Just again seems like a contrivance to support the plot direction.

And then Will telling 70 year old Picard that he hopes he can become a father someday seemed…weird.

Hell, thanks to a certain someone _Rick Berman_ she barely even had a character in TNG to actually contradict. If you challenged me to describe Crusher as a character prior to this season I'd probably say 'Mother, Doctor, sex candle afficionado' which is more of a character pitch than a character in her own right. 

Then we add in the fact that post TNG, she experienced the entire Dominion war on top of the events of the TNG movies, all of which are lifetime PTSD worthy individually, let alone together. 

Then we add in that she's lost not one, but two of the people closest to her to Picard's orbit and it seems perfectly reasonable that if she got pregnant, that she'd want Picard to ditch the adventuring shenanigans or not be a part of the kids life - unfortunately Picard's career and her lack of ability to contact him made the decision on his behalf in her view which _is_ wrong but as I've said elsewhere, the beauty of the writing here is that we sympathise with both sides. I can absolutely see how this Beverly Crusher evolved from the events of TNG/DS9/VOY/Movies, as I can see how Picard did. 

Crusher isn't Carol Marcus, as much as I've bemoaned the TMP era plot points being used they're going very different directions with it. Carol Marcus told Kirk but asked him to keep away, Crusher didn't tell Picard because he was too busy being shot at when she wanted too.

&gt;Like I say, the only difference in outcomes was whose weapons disabled the Titan.


You don't know for certain what the outcome would have been. Turning to fire is not definitive. Firing and being hit with you're own torpedoes is. Theorizing about what could happen is only useful before an action is taken. Once the action is complete you have to look at the scenario for what it is not what it could have been. The scenario that is is that Picard pushed for the torpedoes to be fired. They were fired. They were used against the ship and disabled it. What Vadic could have done to disable the ship is no longer useful information as it is an outcome that will never come. 

&gt;I mean before Riker, in a very un-Riker-like outburst, completely loses his mind and accuses Picard of killing everybody. 

&gt;A good captain does not assign blame in the heat of the moment. They seek solutions to the problem, not have a defeatist little tantrum. Instead of that, he could have asked his crew for options.

&gt;Obviously that makes for a worse cliffhanger.

While I agree he should not have attacked Picard in the way he did. I'm pretty sure he was kicked off the bridge after the ship was disabled be before it was pointed out they were falling in the gravity well. Even if he hadn't. The entire scene from the ship being disabled to the end of the episode only lasts at most 15 seconds.

The basic problem with any other genre of shows set in the ST universe, though, is basically the effects and prop budget.

Whenever Star Trek has attempted anything remotely resembling that (Holodeck episodes) they still always default back to the sci-fi plot devices.

Now, the Shrike seems to have a working, calibrated, refined version of tech that was supposedly only experimental or theoretical at the Daystrom Institute when it was stolen.  And that tech has been perfected by not one but two different villains in a matter of, what, days or weeks since being stolen?  Ridiculous.

The first two portal uses on the Titan took some time to charge it up and fire the projectile.  The third use with the torpedoes was an instant, point-blank shot.  THAT bugs the shit out of me.

The Titan was ready for warp and the order given, yet it remained on impulse and flew straight into the portal both times.  What the hell?  Did the warp drive just... not engage?

That's a good read - I agree. It's one of the reasons why Seven's bisexuality in Picard doesn't bother me.

Weird segue, but bear with me 😅

She's grown up in the collective for all of her childhood, and Voyager is the first point where her human drives and whims are starting to appear. A lot of people rail against Seven being a lesbian/bisexual character in Picard and point to her relationship with Chakotay as if it's some sort of argument ender.

The relationship that literally started on the last episode of the show, and at the beginning of Seven's burgeoning attempts at sexuality. She's akin to a child going through puberty in an adult body. I can believe that she might date Chakotay at first because it's a normal pairing, and then discovered her actual leanings through further dates and partners the way a lot of people do.

But, to come back to the original point, that's why I don't think Seven would necessarily be a Starfleet joiner. She's certainly talented enough to qualify but I just don't think she would handle the chain of command.

Perhaps she has changed and matured, as I have suggested with the above sexuality comments, but the show doesn't really appear to suggest that.

Assuming this is an entity communicating with and addressing Jack, it's quite weird that it would shift from using first person sentences to third person sentences related to the (presumptive) person it's addressing.

It's possible that it's addressing Jack by name in the last sentence (i.e. ""Jack, [something]""), but the rhythm of the line doesn't feel like it lines up with that.

God, someone besides me remembers this 🙏

Such a shame TrekBBS purged most of their threads before 2008 because it would have made a good archive for how completely done everyone was with the 20+ episode format. ENT's fourth season got 22 episodes and not one person lamented the loss. 

The other part of that too that people have forgotten or perhaps too young to remember: VOY ad ENT *were* network shows. They were Paramount's other failed vanity project UPN, where the network very much wanted more TNG clones. Even Rick Berman, uncreative hack that he is, begged the network to postpone ENT for a year and to have the first season take place on Earth to set up the eventual flight into space and he got told in no uncertain terms that if he didn't do it, someone else will. UPN is why ENT got that time travel plot shoehorned into the series that no one wanted to do and only did enough with it to satisfy the network, then got rid of it at the first opportunity.

The fact that all five shows are all creatively distinct from one another is precisely *why* franchise fatigue hasn't set in and why Alex Kurtzman is not nearly as despised as Berman was in the 2000s, certain Fandom Menace types notwithstanding.

What's going on inside a warp core is that from one end in comes a stream of deuterium (an isotope of hydrogen) and in from the other end comes a stream of anti-deuterium. These two streams meet inside the dilithium crystal where they annihilate each other. Even in real life these two streams would produce quite a lot of energy, but it would be in the form of a pretty uncontrollable spray of exotic particles and radiation in all directions. The sci-fi magic of dilithium is that it can contain this reaction and turn almost all of it directly into power in the form of super heating warp plasma. That super-heated warp plasma is then channeled to the warp nacelles where it flowing through the nacelles are what actually generates the warp field.  


So, ultimately, the ship runs on anti-matter. It's just that dilithium allows the anti-matter annihilation to be contained and channeled. Without such magic sci-fi containment, just a table spoon of anti-matter combined with a table spoon of regular matter would release an explosion about 100 times that of the bomb dropped on Hiroshima. This is why damage to the warp core is so bad. Because without all the containment systems ensuring that anti-matter only reacts with matter inside the dilithium crystal, you'd just have a city leveling explosion inside your ship.  


The reason dilithium, even for the non-lazy writers who are aware of all of this, is treated almost like it's the fuel is because you can get anti-matter anywhere, you just need any other less powerful but abundant power source and you can synthesize it.

Throughout their broadcasts they advertise their other shows, conveniently accessible on that same channel, set your DVR.  Having SNW advertised as ""tune in Thursday night, 8pm"" versus ""download [and pay for] Paramount+ to stream now"" would act as a greater draw for more casual viewers.

If that were to come to pass, I don't think Trek will necessarily get watered-down.  The casual swearing might disappear or just get censored for the broadcast (and be unedited on Paramount+), but I think the type of storytelling set up across season one wouldn't be off-putting to casual viewers.",,,False,False,[],False,{},,,False,False,True,t3_11f7ved,,,True,/r/startrek/comments/11f7ved/the_future_of_star_trek_tv_remains_unclear_as/jan9axg/,public,False,,[],1677777940,r/startrek,0,,,,1677777980,1677777981,d5458e9711033eab68f8d025e831474fb9f210dc,,2023-03-02 17:25:40,

Yeah, agreed.

&gt;But whether the approach of spending those millions on ten or twelve hours of content instead of three is any more sustainable is also questionable—with all the streamers realizing their aggressive reach for new subscribers over profitability and the rise in interest rates, I expect there's going to be a contraction in shows in short order. Since it's all internal we don't really have any metrics to judge success for these shows, but I doubt they're making hundreds of millions of dollars equivalent in the short term like a film, and the benefit of having it one's catalog long-term is also questionable (as demonstrated by the recent WB/HBO stuff, sometimes it's cheaper to cut content and stop paying royalties for it/write it off.)

I think the thing is that Star Trek has always been more… consistent? with series than it has been with films. Most(?) TOS films worked, despite being of a variety of subgenres (IV has a very different tone than II). Most TNG films, OTOH, did not work, IMO. They didn't have the same tone as the TNG _series_, and didn't manage to develop their own approach either (unlike TOS, which figured it out starting with II). And the Kelvin films? I don't want to do the silly ""is it even real Trek"" argument (it is if Paramount wants it to be), but I just don't feel they found the right… fit for them. The TOS films continued the legacy of TOS; the TNG ones that of TNG. The Kelvin films try to reboot the TOS films, but with characters who aren't _quite_ the same, and for whom we have no additional backstory.

Series run long enough that you get a chance to get comfortable with their characters and their tone. (Unless you're PIC, in which case the characters keep changing, but I digress.) Films don't get that opportunity. They need to stand on their own, and the Kelvin films, IMO, just aren't good at that.

Thomas was initially wary of accepting the terms offered to him, but Kira pointed out that it would accomplish his mission and let his crew escape Cardassian imprisonment, even challenging his reluctance as some kind of death wish, a desire to go out in a blaze of glory in order to distinguish himself from the further-advanced William Riker.

Immediately after Thomas surrendered the Defiant to the Galor-class cruisers of the Cardassian Central Command, the Kraxon extended its shields around the Defiant to protect her from the fast approaching ships from Orias (upgraded Keldon-class cruisers with markedly higher top speeds than regular ships of the class). Dukat was confident that the Orias ships would not dare fire on Cardassian ships. Upon seeing this, the ships from Orias – under the command of the Obsidian Order and not technically part of the Cardassian military – turned around and returned to the Orias system.

I think it's slightly different, but similar. The trolley problem operates on a couple of levels:

Do you pull the level and take moral responsibility for the death of fewer people or fail to act and allow a greater number of people to die?

Is inaction the same as action in this example?

How do you value lives, by number or do they have an intrinsic and inalienable value?

It's useful because it hits a ton of different moral systems and provides a great jumping off point for discussion of them.

Tuvix is less of a one-stop-shop for this, as it deals with the merging of two people. You could still make a utilitarian argument that preserving two people is better than one, but it's not really the focus of the situation. 

What I think is more important to Tuvix is a right to life argument. It's been a long time since I watched Tuvix, but I recall that Tuvix himself is a strong advocate for his own right to life in favour of Tuvok and Neelix. 

He argues that since the accident merged them was not the action of anyone, there's no moral basis to reverse it. To do so would be to kill him in fact, which is a morally reprehensible act. He clearly states he wishes to live and continue to exist as he is. So does his right and wish to live outweigh that of Tuvok and Neelix who were essentially destroyed to create Tuvix? 

The problem is that because what happened was an accident, the action of fusing Tuvix is morally neutral. We have no rule that was broken to justify reversing it. Arguably each person in the equation has an equal and irreducible right to life. So we have to fall back on what are really very tertiary and thin reasons to prefer Tuvok and Neelix over Tuvix: familiarity and preexistence.

Tuvok and Neelix were there first, so they preexisted Tuvix. We also know Tuvok and Neelix from before the episode, they are familiar to us. We're predisposed to want the return of familiar people. The event that caused it was an accident, weakly we might prefer returning the situation to its pre-accident circumstances. 

Tuvix argues in favour of presence and inertia. He's here now, and if one does nothing one doesn't need to *do* anything to ensure his survival. This is less emotive than acting to kill Tuvix. Additionally, with the morally neutral accident being the cause, there's nothing specifically calling for it to be reversed. What necessity is there to correct everything random that happens in the world? 

The thing is, in reality, both options involve this so no matter how emotive it might be, no choice is free from this. There's no ""third option"" to preserve all the lives in this. This means that if you're weighing the choices, you can't really place weight in favour of one option or the other based on the argument against killing; that's going to be the case either way. The numbers aren't meaningfully different enough to be differently weighted like the trolley problem.

Therefore Janeway bases her decision on what appears to be her emotional familiarity with Tuvok and Neelix, as well as the fact they were there first. Narratively, this would also be preferred due to practical concerns.

Shaw wasn't wrong when he said they were putting themselves ahead of everyone else there and I don't think he meant just in terms of their goals on the ship.  I think they were thinking with their own emotions first rather than putting those to the side and trying to see things from an objective perspective without emotions interfering at all.

I wouldn't be surprised if Starfleet still has an ongoing psych profile on the both of them and those profiles are why they've been kept away from any sort of duties involving starships at all or command positions.  Neither of them was acting like how a commanding officer would and and should act.  Both of them were reacting based off of their own personal emotions that were fueling and contaminating their Command Decisions that should not have happened at all and would never have happened in the past.  I love that you brought up that interaction between Data and Worf because for me that's the gold standard of how one should conduct themselves on the bridge of the Starship when they're in those kinds of positions  of the captain or the first officer.

All of that protocol, all of those traditions, and all of that common sense when right out the window and Shaw saw that straight away right off from the get-go and he knew that the whole thing was going to be a pure shit show if he didn't try to keep things on the rails. I think he very much has had experience with similar captains in the past who made similar decisions and acted in a similar way to them that got a whole bunch of people killed and that has left its mark on him for life. They painted him and his ship and his crew into a corner though and he had to make the best possible call with what he had at hand.   I think that's why he even started asking Jack for help in a way because he probably guessed what exactly was going down on the bridge right at that moment and assumed that someone younger in years with less of a rigid mind who was prone to getting very creative in pressure cooker circumstances might be able to do more good for his crew than they were on the bridge.

If Picard and Riker had walked into this type of situation as a simulation on the Holodeck without any of the stuff involving either of their families coming beforehand then I genuinely believe that they would have been able to quickly deduce a solution to the problem at hand and find a way out before the Titan got so messed up and her crew got so injured.  They should have absolutely been asking just how they were being tracked so easily and should have very quickly figured out that they were leaving a trail behind them and how to stop it and how to take advantage of it but that didn't happen.  They should have also been able to put aside their personal bullshit in order to look out for the mental emotional physical well-being of the ship's crew without a corrupting their decisions at all or influencing them in any way.  They had a crack young crew at their hands who had seen a lot of stuff and were more updated on current technology and strategy than they were and that should have been combined with their own previous experiences in dealing with overwhelming odds and the strategies involved to concoct a masterful plan that would have overcome and beaten everything.

What instead happened is a classic example of why old people are clearly not allowed on the bridge of a starship anymore and what happens when you let badmirals take command.

That was messy as hell on purpose and I think it needed to happen to really knock some sense into the both of them.  Sure they may have had a few fun cowboy moments in recent times but those times are becoming fewer and far between and far more risky to pull off and get away from scot-free.  The universe has become more brutal, more hostile, and far more creative in ways that have adapted to the tactics of old and no longer tolerates fools or mistakes like it used to.  Starfleet Captains are not the wileiest and most creative beings out there with an instant ""I win"" button anymore.  Life in the galaxy has adapted to them, to the Federation, and to Starfleet and along the way it has taken its toll on everyone involved and will continue to make people who aren't aware of this or who don't recognize it pay a heavy price.

We saw that price paid tonight with Picard and Riker and it was most certainly in blood and it was most certainly their fault because of their own actions that they were warned about by Shaw from the get-go and that they went through with anyways thinking that they had enough Winchester Style plot armor to survive whatever may happen and to help those around them survive whatever consequences could possibly befall them.

They were wrong.

And, to be clear, the budget of Star Trek streaming series isn't _that_ low. An episode of Picard is roughly $10M. Given ten episodes per season (so, about $100M a season), that's not… much less than the budgets of the Kelvin films: $150M, $190M, $185M.

(Discovery's budget per episode is a bit lower at $8M, but its seasons are longer, so you end up at roughly the same $100M a season. And both Picard and Discovery have multiple seasons, so you're _well_ within Hollywood budgets…)

This doesn't really leave much room for a direct-to-video film, with a budget presumably… in between those two?

Really, there isn't a good answer to this question. Arguably they all have an equal right to life, so the choice ends up being solely based on preference or on the basis of pre-existence. This is why Janeway's decision is so easy to paint as a bad or callous one. She literally has no moral framework to fall back on in terms of rights or preference.

Somewhere along the lines, he learned about and gained an appreciation for human music, and the kind that Picard would have enjoyed. Then consider that post-Nemesis, he likely spent time on the Enterprise as Picard's number one, since the best candidates for that had either died or moved on.

Star Trek: HGTV. Various ships in varying states of disrepair are remodeled and flipped. The season finale is Deep Space Nine, and it's repainted gold with extra energy weapon banks, torpedos, and new runabouts in reimagined docks.

\---

Star Trek: Twelfth. The Doctor is returned to his Twelfth form and a new sonic screwdriver - except it's Malcolm Tucker. He has to deal with Federation politics and battle. Joined Trills are his companions, as they know a thing or two about extra lives. The dialogue is... pithy.

\---

Star Trek: Insurance. There's a small department in the Federation headquarters and a matching one on the Klingon and Romulan homeworlds that deal with insurance policies of all kinds. They know a thing or two about a thing or two and they all drink heavily at the stupid things they have to deal with. 

\---

Star Trek: Odo. ***Quarrrrrrrrrk...***

\---

Star Trek: Intimate Pleasures. Unlike what the title might suggest, it's just the misadventures of a Federation adult bookstore clerk that has to deal with spacers and the like that come in to make purchases. Nothing ever works out to plan, and when the Borg/Romulans/Klingons/Villain of the week show up, it's no better. In fact, sometimes the clerk breathes a sigh of relief, as she knows her commission will go up.

Star Trek: Mysteries, Inc. A crack team of investigators roam about the galaxy, solving cases that befuddle everyone else. Their ship is a Defiant-class ship painted in the most eyewatering psychedelic scheme that manages to glow in the darkness of space and there's a mutt of some kind onboard. It's not quite canine, not quite...

No matter the century, the correctional officers of any century have to deal with prisoners that claim they're not guilty, that try to lie, steal, manipulate, and get out of lockup, and that do all kind of things.

I like this interpretation. We see it in Insurrection - the Enterprise E is off on a bunch of cushy diplomatic missions while most of Starfleet is fighting on the front lines of the Dominion War.

For the most part, the same problems remain: plotting advances at a snail's pace, dragging out what should take ten minutes into three episodes. Virtually everything in the plot is built on references to the past rather than trying anything new. No interest in the spirit of exploration, discovery, introspection, reflection or philosophy which is at the core of every classic Trek series: it's still just angst, explosions and beheadings. Characters make ridiculous decisions or act in ways that belie being trained officers of Starfleet, and are all remarkably bad at their jobs. Raffi on a seedy nightclub planet doing melodrama and feeling sorry for herself. Every scene is incredibly underlit, with the bridge of the most regularly featured ship barely lit at all. A ton of lazy mistakes that either contradict key tenets of the Trek universe, or just make characters look mind-bogglingly stupid (someone thinks it can be afternoon in an entire solar system).

Is it terrible? No, it started mediocre and is trending slightly downwards after the last episode. It's not a painful hate-watch like S1 - which delighted in saying everything Trek valued and believed in was wrong, stupid and destined to fail in the nastiest possible ways - and while the opening two episodes of S2 were stronger than those of S3, there isn't as obvious a red flag of impending doom as the whole season being set in contemporary(ish) Los Angeles. It's just not very good and continues to bet fans can be placated with surface-level winks and nudges rather than good character writing, tight and original plotting, or any of the intellectual substance which gives Trek its soul (for me, anyhow).",,,False,False,[],False,{},,,False,False,True,t3_11fvwpz,,,True,/r/startrek/comments/11fvwpz/episode_discussion_star_trek_picard_3x03/jamf9v4/,public,False,,[],1677765794,r/startrek,0,,,,1677765809,1677765810,4011703393296be8264a53dda514e4cc646ac2c2,,2023-03-02 14:03:14,

We've also kind of done this song and dance before during the Dominion War with the Changelings.  So they're going to have to try really hard and pull of some really special stuff in order to make it stand out from everything that's come before and everything that's already been done before.  That's a tall order and it's made even taller by how the writers have handled stuff in the past with this show and how the audience has reacted to some of their decisions.

Dragging the Dominion War skeletons out of the closet just feels a bit too recent, a bit too known, and it seems like it would be hard to adapt that DS9 grade stuff to a tone that would fit the TNG/Picard era cast.  DS9 and TNG were vastly different shows on multiple levels and even the first episode of DS9 felt a bit like putting two puzzle pieces together that didn't quite fit together perfectly.  So somehow being able to wiggle that stuff together decades later felt like an impossible risk that not even the Picard writers would take and that's why no one ever really walked down that particular road with their theories.

The fact that they did choose that path is throwing so many of us for a loop because it's the exact opposite of what we all thought they were going to do.  They could still bring in the conspiracy bugs at some point or even the Elachi or the Iconians or a host of other baddies though.  There's just so many WTF-Unknowns right now and I'm wondering if even Jack's comment has a few more layers than we realize.

It honestly could've been a mixture of Changelings and normal corrupted/bribed Solids along with a host of other similar infiltrator type species that have hated the Federation for a long time and have been waiting to take their shot at them for a while in a way that would actually do some damage.

I didn't realize he was in both Enterprise AND The Sarah Connor Chronicles AND Gotham AND Heroes AND both Angel &amp; Buffy.

I also didn't realize how much of a D&amp;D nerd he was because now I'm going through his instagram and I'm seeing sooooooo many D&amp;D related names and people that I'm familiar with that I'm honestly surprised and shocked that I haven't seen him before on this or that stream.  There's just shot after shot and story after story of him with dice or a DM screen or his massive NERD collection of stuff.  His gaming room looks insane!  I am ashamed that I have not found out about this amazing man sooner and I really feel like I should have!

There's even a Sandman connection via Mason Alexander Park!

Someone hook him up with Matt Lillard or Mercer or Brennan for maximum D&amp;D hijinks already!  Annnd there's a picture of him with Liam and then [there's this gem](https://www.instagram.com/p/CVDwf2QJuoC/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link) and now I'm scrolling further and I'm realizing that I have seen him before once or twice at GaryCon as well as during the yearly D&amp;D Celebration stuff and Jasper's Game Day and Scum &amp; Villainy. 

Well now I just feel silly, it's funny how some people can just hang around in the background of things that you love and you never realize they're there until they pop up in the front of one of those things you really love.

The changelings were minding their own business in the gamma quadrant, then the Federation came along preaching messages of peace which threatened their structure. 

So they started a war and they would have won that war had the Federation not betrayed all of it's ideals to infect _one of their own people_ with a virus that then infected the link. 

They then, at literal gun point, got the founder on Cardassia to stand down and surrender.

 \- but for me he is disappointing mainly because of how little he grows, changes , or develops over the shows. Worf has the record of being the character to appear in the most Star Trek episodes, so he has the most time and potential to go through a meaningful character journey. Unfortunately this does not happen.

&amp;#x200B;

Early in Next Gen , Worf is established as a stubborn , stoic, gruff person, based on how most of us would characterise a typical Klingon. But this is later revealed to not be the case ; most Klingons are not like Worf. He has an incorrect belief of how Klingons are supposed to live because he grew up around humans not Klingons. In the episode where Riker is serving on a Klingon ship, he says he never knew Klingons would laugh and tell jokes so much. Klingons love to celebrate and party, chase romance and adventure. They are also dishonest, insecure, and use the term 'honor' as a catchall justification for whatever action they take in their self interest. However Worf believes they are truly honorable and stoic because his only accounts are second or third hand accounts. 

&amp;#x200B;

You might think this makes Worf more honorable than other Klingons, and to be fair he is in some respects. He is noble and a man of his word, compared to most Klingons. The problem is, even after spending time with other Klingons, he never changes or learns lessons from them. He never learns to loosen up, celebrate or enjoy himself like a Klingon. Similarly, he spent 7+ years serving on the Enterprise, working closely and learning from Picard, Data, Riker, Troi. But this doesn't influence his personality in any way. He doesn't learn compassion, empathy, or kindness form them.  

He is an objectively *terrible* father , even by Klingon standards. Despite being 'more' honorable than Klingons, he still acquiesces to the will of the council even when it involves lies and deception. Later on Deep Space Nine he is still unapproachable , to the point where he prefers to sleep on a docked ship rather than the space station. On one mission the defiant is travelling past damaged ships with potential survivors, he justifies not helping them by saying something along the lines of 'victory will bring honor'. He is confronted again by how much he has failed as a father and even Martok calls him out on it.  One of the worst moments of all, is when asks Bashir to wipe his brother Kurn's memory without his consent, rather than try to deal with his depression and psychological issues. How honorable is wiping your brothers memory, so he will basically go away and cease being a problem?

But worst of all, is his treatment of his romantic partners, specifically K'Ehleyr, Jadzia and Ezri. 

&amp;#x200B;

When  K'Ehleyr and Worf sleeps together , he wants her to be his partner for life. She refuses and he acts like a petulant child, not taking her feelings into consideration. But with Jadzia ... I think its fair to describe is a toxic relationship. Another redditor summed it up pretty well here, where they identified things in Worf's treatment of Jadzia with their own real life experiences with toxicity [https://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/bhr4h5/ds9\_i\_hate\_the\_romantic\_relationship\_between\_worf/](https://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/bhr4h5/ds9_i_hate_the_romantic_relationship_between_worf/)

I also hope I don't need to bring up the fact that Worf, a senior officer in Starfleet, committed *literal terrorism* on Risa, because he was angry at Jadzia's swimsuit being too revealing.

And of course with Ezri, there is the classic storyline where he becomes angry with her for seducing him and sleeping with him (as if he had no say in the matter), demands he stay away from her , then also becomes angry that she develops feelings for Bashir! 

&amp;#x200B;

Contrast all this with another long running character like Spock, see how different he is at the end of his time with Trek vs his beginning. He is a different person, his experiences have changed him. Early on he would use 'logic' to justify anything, similar to a Klingon using 'honor'. But at the end he tells a younger Vulcan “Logic is the beginning of wisdom, not the end.” showing how much he has grown. I really wish something like this had happened with Worf. Sure he could remain as stoic and tough as ever, but I wish he had developed a little more empathy or compassion, that he surely could have learned from his time with the other characters. If he respects Picard as much as he says he does, why hasn't he learned anything from him?

This rogue faction most likely doesn’t want anyone to know that the Changelings are involved; after all, their goal is to “keep Starfleet spinning.” The criminal shapeshifting in public into a hawk to fly away would just shine a brutal spotlight on Changeling involvement and would thus alert the Federation about the newest threat; I’m sure that Starfleet has set up contingency plans for a rogue Changeling operation. Worf knows all of this, which is why he has the high-tech cuffs, which upon the reveal of the changelings evoked the device Garak used to keep Odo from changing form.

Prior to the Dominion War, the Founders *wanted* to be seen; it played into their strategy of selling fear and confusion, and division. Even evidence of a rogue changeling attack would do just the opposite; it would unite the Alpha Quadrant again in a way not seen since the dominion war. The Dominion doesn’t want a war any more than the Federation does. Last time they tried to send a fleet to the Alpha Quadrant via the wormhole, their ships disappeared just because Sisko *asked* the profits. Now he *is* a Prophet. They know that Sisko is a Prophet because Odo knows that, so they have to resort to other means.

I’m not sure how this ties into Vadic. She is definitely being financed by an outside operation, but she is simply a bounty hunter. She is professional and methodical, as evidenced by her commands such as “one more [torpedo launch]” on the Shrike’s bridge. She also has every plan and contingency covered, as shown by the portal that turns the *Titan’s* torpedo fire back on itself. Whether she was hired by the rogue changeling faction to exact revenge on Picard by attacking his son or whether that splinter group has allied itself with her while both work for her financier remains to be seen. I tend to think it is the latter, as it doesn’t make sense for the Changelings to target Picard as an act of revenge, since Dominion’s main strategic opponent was Sisko instead of Picard.",,,False,False,[],False,{},,,False,False,True,t3_11fvwpz,,,True,/r/startrek/comments/11fvwpz/episode_discussion_star_trek_picard_3x03/jalzhay/,public,False,,[],1677756755,r/startrek,0,,,,1677756766,1677756767,035b7cf92bdcc33ad9f7a611275f820816170e7d,,2023-03-02 11:32:35,

If they had wanted to do that scene, they should have stepped back to the captain’s ready room, had the fight privately, and then if Jean-Luc wanted to leave, he could have.

I’ll forgive Riker for this, if only for the range of stress and emotions he was under.

That nebula looks...less than hospitable to normal life.  So what if it's the Silver Blood aliens from Voyager because they could survive on a planet in a hellish place like that right?

Something's itching at the back of my brain though and it's about how they kept saying that they were detecting biological stuff with each of those energy surges.  Now initially this sounds a lot like the electrical impulses that fire between neurons within our brains and make us all giant flesh bags of electrified meat and water.  This would then lead us to believe that the nebula is acting like one MASSIVE cosmic kind of a brain, right?

But what if it's something different?  In the Sandman Overture comic, there's a particular panel that deals with something very similar.  It shows massive armies preparing for the war to end all wars and then it talks about how certain races noticed brilliant electrical flashes that were light years wide arcing between and through nebulae.  The panel goes on to say that they thought it was just pure energy but that in actuality, the flashes themselves were massive armies of sentient beings.  What if that's what's going on with this nebula?

The errant power surges are just merely individuals of some kind of non-corporeal race interacting with the Titan and the gravity well they're currently falling towards is actual the center of their civilization where they're all the most concentrated.

Everyone outside of that particular sector just writes the whole thing off as a massive navigational hazard that's similar to the Badlands and an utter death trap while having no clue that it's actually a bunch of sentient beings.

Soooooooo in keeping with the whole TNG theme, maybe they wind up exploring a strange new world at the bottom of this gravity well and find a new form of life and a brand new civilization with it which then sends them boldly where no one has gone before?

A new Changling Homeworld on the door step of the Federation would be the simplest answer though and I hope we get some shades of Z'ha'dum with them having allied with races like the Elachi or some other enemies of the Federation.",,,False,False,[],False,{},,,False,False,True,t3_11fvwpz,,,True,/r/startrek/comments/11fvwpz/episode_discussion_star_trek_picard_3x03/jalxbld/,public,False,,[],1677755144,r/startrek,0,,,,1677755161,1677755162,72efa1799a3491bfe677ce1aaa9f54b738c0aab2,,2023-03-02 11:05:44,

My guess is that whomever is working with this rogue group has modified them in some way so that they cannot shift as easily as regular Changelings can but they do have some advantages that regular Changelings do not.

You could also put it down to them being rejected from the Great Link and being unable to rejoin with all the others OR them just being at the end of their solid cycle wherein they didn't have the energy or capability to shapeshift and escape Worf and Raffi without turning into a puddle right then and there on the spot.

I think Riker might wind up being more protective of Jack than Jean Luc will be because of this.

We're probably going to get this anyways, but I want to see Jean Luc asking Jack why he never reached out to him at all despite knowing when and how and where to find him.  I feel like it's going to be a very child like, ""I was scared"" kind of an answer but I could also see it being a bit more complicated.  How do you approach a legend and tell him ""Hey I'm your kid"" without it going badly right off the bat?

It would upset your entire world and I think Jack didn't want that at all.  He just wanted his mum.  Sure knowing who his dad is was absolutely great buuuuut...the status quo was more preferable than the chaos that any kind of change would cause.  Plus if any of Bev's stories about Jean Luc were true then it was almost a guarantee that their lives would be upended either by Jean Luc or someone adjacent to him if Jack ever approached him about being his kid.

Although Janeway's is a bit bigger because &gt;!the Dauntless was more of a permanent command for her!&lt; and Seven's is more pocket sized because of her constant moving around.

That either means it's a planet or a star or a black hole or some kind of massive space dwelling being.....or a wormhole that something or SOMEONE is maintaining the gravitational eddies of and is using the nebula as a very passive kind of cosmic electric fence to keep people away.

I wonder if Sisko got kicked out by the Prophets and he's in exile on some kind of a planet or in his own little mini-Celestial Temple and is going to give them a ride back home?

Or maybe it's a backdoor that connects to the Bajoran Wormhole and the Prophets have been....spreading out for a while because of Sisko's influence in an attempt to get to know the people of linear time a bit better?

Or maybe it's some kind of an Iconian Research Facility that Jack will be able to unlock and control because of something in his DNA that was actually within Picard's DNA as well but that would only activate within his offspring because symbolism and those ancient aliens from ""The Chase""?

Tonight's episode showed them interacting, so this is just a coincidence. I didn't really find it strange they didn't talk before. That was likely to keep the fact he was a love-child a secret. 

&gt;!I've seen leaks from people who have seen the first 6 episodes and this observation is not significant. As others stated, not everything needs to be a twist.!&lt;  

&gt; Age/when was he born?  

Answered in interviews. He's around 24/25.  

&gt; What were the circumstances of his birth? (cloned, etc)  

Answered in tonight's episode. He's Picard and Beverly's son. 

&gt; Why was he kept secret from Jean-Luc?  

Answered in tonight's episode. Beverly lost her husband and Wesley to space-drama. Picard attracts it like a black hole. Remember when that Ferengi faked a son just so he could kill him in front of Picard? Beverly didn't want the same thing to happen to Jack. There's also the issue that Picard expressed not wanting to have children, and the unresolved trauma of his own family issues. I'm sure more will be said on this.  

&gt; His dialect. Why does he have it/where was he raised?  

Answered this episode. He grew up in London, picked up the accent and kept it there.   

&gt; Why does he seem to be such a miscreant?  

That was answered in episode two for the most part. Picard was also a hell raiser when he was younger and even as an adult he didn't have the habit of worrying about the law when it came to doing the right thing.

Hell of a scene between Jean-Luc and Beverly, and I daresay it wouldn't have half the weight it did, if we didn't know the truth of Jean-Luc's past from the last two seasons, so absolutely bravo on that.

Indeed, we needed all of that build up and all of those moments for anything in this season and these scenes to really hit as hard as they did and to make as much sense as they did.

&gt; there's no one right answer

That's the most realistic part of Star Trek, when it comes to people, there is not always a right answer.  Sometimes things are just messy and emotional and good people make bad choices in the heat of the moment because they think that they're doing the right thing.  Hindsight is 20/20 after all.

&gt; Shaw

I thought he was a dead man when he got thrown through the air and I gasped LOUDLY when all that blood was coming out of him.  I'm attached now and I want to see him pull through everything and resolve whatever it is that's going on with him.

&gt; Michael Dorn...Worf

I found how he spoke and what Worf said to be rather relatable as I've gone through something similar.  At some point as you get older, you begin to realize just how much energy you're wasting on rage and anger and it gives you a bit of perspective.  You see things in a new light and all that chaotic blood boiling energy melts away simmering down into something far more controlled like a matter-anti matter reaction that's now being moderated by dilithium crystals.

You then begin to channel it in other ways and while you were great at some things before, you become even better at them now, because you're not wasting all that extra energy on silly bullshit like you were before.

You kind of level up in a way like Worf has.

&gt; Thomas Dekker

I barely recognized him when he showed up on screen but the second he started doing things with his face it all just kind of clicked and I had to wait until the credits to be sure.  I was a MASSIVE TSCC fan back in the day and I still remember literally running home after work to catch the very first episode on FOX.  It was so cool to see him on the show tonight and also very fitting that someone from the Terminator franchise would wind up playing a Changeling of all things.

&gt; Lore and Moriarty

I think they're going to be interrogating the two of them at Daystrom because the both of them played a part in the theft of whatever was stolen buuuuut while they're there, something is going to happen which will wind up hooking up Worf and Raffi with Picard and Crew.  I just can't put my finger on what.  The Portal Tech was all a distraction and that was horrible enough, so what could be worse than that AND Lore and Moriarty combined?

What kind of a secret is Daystrom hiding?

&gt; Odo

I cried, I miss him.

&gt; LaForge/Seven scene

Maybe I'm wrong but I got the sense that Seven saw her and then Jack as stand ins for B'Elanna and Tom in a way, with each of them delivering similar messages to her that their Voyager counterparts would've easily espoused had they been there to give them.

Geordi always did have a way with words and friends and it's nice to see that having been passed down to his daughters.

&gt; Worlds that Starfleet forgot

Shades of the Maquis anyone?

I'm getting the sense that part of the reason why &gt;!the Federation began falling apart in the future prior to the Burn!&lt; was because there were a lot more enemies and a lot more cracks in the foundation of the Federation than even they realized.  The whole thing is one giant group of civilizations jerry rigged together and it's barely holding together.

&gt; Jack

He just needs a cause to believe in and much like Picard, when he finds one, he goes all in.

&gt; Seven

Hallucination Seven smiling warmed my heart but also freaked me out at the same time.

&gt; Starship Porn

Over and over and over and omonomonomnom gimme gimme gimme!

&gt; Choral Music

Shades of the Pak'ma'ra 

&gt; They shouldn't have had it out on the bridge

I feel like prior to ""everything happening"" with the two of them, Riker and his family and Jean Luc with his drama, that they would've kept things rather chill and professional on the bridge.  Things have changed though, the moment was stressful, and they both began to crack and push each other's buttons.  These are not the young Starfleet Officers we knew from back in the day but two rusty old men who are not supposed to be there at all, let alone in command, for some very very good reasons.

One of those being how they can wind up doing exactly what they did which just demoralizes the entire crew.

&gt; more optimistic

• Riker's levity was great this episode. His ""oh shit"" when Deanna popped up, his talk with Jack, all of it. What's going on with his command style though? Is he scared like Picard suggests, or is Picard being too reckless? I couldn't tell which they were trying to make us side with. Picard was yelling at him a lot, but Riker also was refusing to listen. Also the way he sent him off the bridge was mean as hell. I don't like my space daddies fighting. :⁠-⁠(

• Shaw was hilarious while we had him. His sarcastic humor and ""this might as well happen"" attitude is a big mood. I'm glad he didn't die, but boy that looked painful.

• Seven was great this episode also. Her Voyager model!! Her little pep-talk from Sidney, getting called Commander Seven, all of it. Her and Jack were fun partners too. Her ""you're insane"" aside to him made me laugh.

• Since I was a small child, the inconsistent sounds on Star Trek has struck a deep OCD nerve in me and this episode really pushed my buttons. The Titan computer sounds like the Voyager/Enteprrise-E one with its beeps, but the doorbells are from the Enterprise-D! The warning beeps are half from the -D and half from Voyager! Just stick with the latest ones or make all new ones!

• The scene with Picard and Beverly was intense. Pstew did an amazing job showing the hurt without vocalizing it at first, and then letting Beverly have it when was just flinging excuses. I was so confused at why Beverly was weirdly hostile towards him since none of her examples were exactly his fault. She did him dirty and that makes me sad. At least they cleared up the accent with a nice and tidy line of dialogue.

• Hey, Riker stole that torpedo-then-phaser maneuver from the Doctor on Voyager! It's a good trick, not sure why we don't see it more.

• I love that they just gave up and call it a portal weapon and a portal attack now. Now Vadic's thinking with portals!

• The music this episode was superb. The subtle mixing in of the First Contact theme is perfection. Worf listening to Berlioz like Picard in FC was an interesting callback.

• Worf and Raffi are like PB&amp;J. Chef's kisses all around. Worf's titles made me laugh out loud. His one-liners are still on point. The chamomile tea! ""Beheadings are on Wednesdays.""

• The Titan-A is growing on me the more I see it in motion. It had some beautiful shots this episode.

• So it's not nubbin' bugs? Changelings?! I definitely didn't expect that one. I'm very interested to see them explore the motivations for this. I'm not looking forward to playing ""Guess the Changeling"" on the Titan for the next few weeks though. Changelings makes sense as to why every faction was after the Crushers, but how many of them are there? Is the rogue group like half the Link? 

• The titular 17 seconds for Picard was a sweet scene also. Not having sound was a great touch. I wish him and Riker would stop bitching each out so he could share it with him.

• What the hell was up with that creepy ""connect the branches"" Seven vision that Jack had? It gave me the jeebies.

• Worf had a Nemesis phaser! My heart leapt with joy. God I miss those things. I love that Word just vaporized the Changeling, no hesitation.

• What they stole from Daystrom is Lore, right? I feel like it's Lore, but I don't get how Changelings would a) know anything pertinent about Lore, and b) use Lore to do anything to end Starfleet or the Federation.

• So everything the Titan had was 4 torpedoes? I don't know the controls and I could have done better than that. They need a new tactical officer.

It starts following Captain Harriman and the *Enterprise-B*. They've been flying for nearly 3 decades, it's 2323, and Captain Harriman (reprised by Alan Ruck) is looking forward to a leisurely final mission patrolling the Federation side of the Romulan Neutral Zone before handing over the reins of the *Enterprise* to his XO, Commander T'Sara.

Unfortunately, sensors pick up the Romulan Warbird *Tomed* she's adrift, sending out an automated distress call, and in the Neutral Zone heading for Federation space. The Romulan Empire refuses to answer any hails, merely responding with standard interlac codes indicating that the zone is inviolable for any Federation vessel.

Harriman knows that he can't enter the zone,  and that this could be a trap. He has the *Enterprise* take a position 10 kilometers on the Federation side of the Neutral Zone border precisely where the *Tomed* is set to cross. He waits. He continues hailing the *Tomed*, which doesn't respond. He raises shields, he arms weapons, he waits. The *Tomed* drifts across the border,  still unresponsive. He blinks. He orders shields down and to take her on tow with a tractor beam,  and for an away team to beam over and investigate.

The crew of the *Tomed* is dead to the last. Power is at minimum, the core is on a recurrent diagnostic safe lock to keep it stable. They appear to have succumbed to some kind of disease.  They take samples, but the transporter biofilters start screaming the second they get pattern lock. They can't beam back, Commander T'sara is infected.

Against Harrimans protests, she volunteers to remain behind while they beam back the other lenders of the away team and the samples to have them analyzed by ships Cheif Medical Officer.

It is at this point that the Romulan Empire makes contact,  claiming that the officer in charge of monitoring that particular stretch of the zone had been relieved of his duties for choosing to ignore the *Enterprise's* hails, and demanding that the *Tomed* not be boarded, not taken under tow, but destroyed.

But it's too late,  obviously. Informed that she'd been boarded,  the Romulans cut off communication with *Enterprise*, and long range sensors detect 4 Romulan Warbirds enter the Neutral Zone on a rendezvous course. Harriman orders that the *Enterprise* set course for the Briar Patch, a region of space at the three way intersection of the Romulan Neutral Zone, the Klingon Empire,  and the Federation, taking the Tomed along still in tow. Sending a message via subspace informing Starfleet Command, a message that will take nearly a day to reach Earth. 

As they enter the Briar Patch the CMO calls up to the Bridge with grave news,  the returning Away Team brought back the virus that killed the *Tomed*, dormant initially in non-vulcanoids, but it's airborne and spreading. Commander T'Sara had been monitoring comms. She updates Harriman on her condition. Her cellular integrity appears to be gradually breaking down, several of her internal organs are already distressed, her vascular system is likely to start breaking down. She estimates she has a few hours before she experiences internal bleeding,  however her hemostatic response is unaffected.  She estimates she has several days before the issue approaches lethality.

The CMO comments that because the XO is Vulcan, her systems are generally a bit hardier than humans, but if the disease effects humans the same way,  even with a delay due to the differences between them,  it could result in casualties within hours.

Harriman orders the ship to engage protocols to limit the spread of the disease.  The Away Team is confined to the medical bay,  nonessential crew confined to quarters, life support is put into an isolation mode whereby bridge air is recycled locally and isn't transferred, same for deck 2, deck 3, and so on. Turbolifts are shut down and Jeffrey's Tubes are sealed.

That was when the Federation and Starfleet began to really test their borders and reach out further into the galaxy which exerted a kind of pressure on other civilizations and entities who then pushed back in their own ways.

That pressure then in turn caused cracks and then fissures and then outright literal and metaphorical breaks to happen within the Federation and within events in the galaxy.  Those cracks and fissures and breaks and that pressure then exerted a toll on the people that were either directly or tangentially involved in them.  The heavy hitters like Picard, Sisko, and Janeway took the brunt of the bow shock while everyone else around them took the secondary waves and wound up becoming collateral damage in their wake.

Beverly gave us a unique window into those people and those effects, as has Lower Decks and Discovery to a degree.  Life in the Federation and within Starfleet is idyllic to a degree but not always and there are certain things that not even Utopia can ignore or wipe away or sweep under the rug.  People are still people and they have their limits and they have their ways that not even a future scifi setting can change.  We are creatures of habit and we are all and they are all still mortal beings who can and will break when too much is too much and too many fantastical things keep happening to them.

Legends are still people too and that's something this show is very good at showing us and teaching us.  The laws of physics apply to everyone and everything.  No one stays who they are forever.  Utopia never provides everything for everyone for all time.  Change is inevitable and it's not always a good change that happens and no one is immune to it at all.

There's always a cost and those costs can add up quite a bit in any kind of setting with any kind of character and not everyone is able to pay the Ferryman.",,,False,False,[],False,{},,,False,False,True,t3_11fvwpz,,,True,/r/startrek/comments/11fvwpz/episode_discussion_star_trek_picard_3x03/jalr8p7/,public,False,,[],1677750095,r/startrek,0,,,,1677750107,1677750107,935b7d6f76ed294315393637162306122688c9a1,,2023-03-02 09:41:35,

* Last week was the equivalent of punching the BBEG in the face and then going, ""Okay byyyeeeeeeeeee""

* ""Send somebody down to look out the back window!""...I'm picturing someone in the shuttle bay going, ""Yeaaah she's still there!""

* Deeper they dove into the mouth of hell, this is some beautiful cinematography

* BEFORE, MORE ROCK MUSIC HELL YES!  Oh nooooo it's a Riker flashback....

* ""His mother..."" oh Jean Luc lol

* ""It took seventeen seconds to get down to sickbay"" oooooh, so Picard is gonna have a similar turbolift ride this episode with Jack then eh?

* They really do love giving us these sexy shots of the Titan don't they?  Wow, they really did have people looking out the windows! lol

* ""Electrical and biological signatures....Well that's fun, anyone else wanna throw more weird shit at me?"" *snort giggles*  I love him already and hey look at that another nebula in Trek that's actually alive!

* Awww he's giving them time off, stand up captain and what is operatic music that just kicked in?

* Of course Seven has a cute little model of Voyager.

* ""This sounds rehearsed"" because it probably is because she's never really had a moment to give this little speech to you even though she's probably always wanted to and now taaa daaaaa.

* ""We have a hard time making friends"" awwww ""Shaw may have called you insubordinate for helping yours but my dad wouldn't"" AWWWWWWW!  Seven's trying not to cry AND SHE CALLED HER COMMANDER SEVEN!  I'm tearing up a bit too that was just great.

* Of course Doctor Oak has Bev working because as if any force in the galaxy could stop her.

* *Dave Matthews voice* The spaaaaace betweeen Bev and Jean Luc.  Well now we have a time frame for Jack.

* ""We ended our relationship...Our romantic relationship for the fifth time"" oooooooof, this is gonna be painful.

* Wow, you know when Bev puts it that way, being in a relationship with Jean Luc and trying to raise a kid is a lot like being in a relationship with a famous adventurer or even a super hero.  Every other day some life threatening situation is going down or there's some galactic issue that needs addressing and that's no environment in which to raise a child.  Plus not everyone can handle that kind of stress as a parent, her and Joe West would get along just fine.

* They both make some valid points and this is some glorious acting!

* This musical cue change, the slow rise.

* ""I know now I would never have been my father, but I could've learned that 20 years before""...annnd I'm crying with Bev.

* She considers Wesley to be lost ""all to the same stars that own Jean Luc""...does this mean he's never visited her once?

* ""I thought I could protect mine, I didn't know if I could protect yours""...wow, she's got big time Lois Lane vibes right now and she's right.  She's totally right.  One woman can't stand against the galaxy alone and Jean Luc would've had to step up in the same way that Crichton did for Aeryn.

* ""Ensign Bernardin"" OH HAI MARC!

* Jack is doing Dad Pacing.

* ""The bigger the legend the more disappointing the reality"" and how many legends have you met Jack?

* Riker dropping some great advice.  Bev told Jack bedtime stories about the Enterprise!

* ""Have you got family Riker?....Feel free to call me Captain and yes I have a wife and a daughter and I HAD a son"" the emphasis on that HAD and Jack's reaction daaaaamn.

* ""Jean Luc Picard sized enemies"" I am stealing that and using it later.

* Hahahahaha Jack's Accent is because he went to school in London and never shook it ""Maybe it's in his DNA"" lol

* WOW!  Bev told Jack who Jean Luc and where to find him and he just...never wanted to do it.  That's BIG!

* Hallway Talk on Star Trek lol

* SHE FOUND THEM!  BATTLESTATIONS FROM THE TRAILER!

* ""The Titan is right where it should be""......someone has temporal knowledge that they shouldn't.

* Oh shiiiiiiit Shaw just got fuuuucked up Enterprise C style.  He's giving Riker the Command Codes!

* BEAM PHASERS!  TORPEDO CONCUSSION!  ""I think it might be time you called me Number One"" lol

* Epic Opera Music for Epic Klingon Warrior Stuff

* Hahahahaha that INTRODUCTION of all the titles that Worf holds annnnd then, ""I have made some tea do you take sugar?"" and Raffi just has no fucking clue what to say to all that jazz lmao

* ""Think of me as, a subcontractor"" there's the Worf Humor

* ""What is wrong with me"" oh Raffi :(

* The rabbit hole goes deeper and they're going down together!

* ""Cool"" indeed

* This really is a game of cat and mouse but the cat always knows where the mouse is.

* Dawww Jack is acting just like his mom, that's sweet.

* Of course Shaw is interrogating Jack while on the table and...NO WAY...are they totally using the exhaust thing from Plummer's Star Trek but with the Titan?

* Uh oh, they're literally in the belly of a beast then.

* Jack's gonna do something very Jean Luc-y

* NOW YOU'RE THINKING WITH PORTALS/WORMHOLES!

* Well this is a fun little time loop, why does she want them to stay in this nebula so much?  She wants Jack.  She wants the ship to stay in the neubla.  She could easily destroy them but she isn't.  There's something that we're missing.

* Worf Casual lol

* ""I just bring it when the moment calls"" badass

* ""Beheadings are on Wednesdays"" lol

* HE WENT TO SEVEN!

* ""Yeaaaaah the thing about that is"" Seven just looks at him and PUUUUUNCH ""You're insane""...she likes him lmao

* Oh hell SABOOOOOOTAAAAAAAAAAAAGE!

* The fuck is up with this nebula that there's a massive gravity well in the middle of it that isn't pulling everything else in but that's also sending out power surges?  Iconian stuff?

* Well there's the friction they warned us about between Riker and Jean Luc.

* Oh hai saboteur! THE FUCK HIS FACE?!?!  CHANGELING?!?!  SOMETHING ELSE?!?!  ELACHI?!?!

* Interrogation!  I rather like this new Worf.  Also his new weapon, very cool and chill.

* Raffi Big Scary

* ""Connect the branches""....soooo what the hell is that hallucination and who is using Seven's image to send Jack a message?

* Flashes of a nebula, a red storm, and a red doorway opening...all this RED symbology...is the Enterprise C still alive somewhere?

* ""GOOOOOOOO!"" the turbolift ride!

* HE'S ALIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIVE!!

* Wait, so the fucking wormhole weapon was a red herring all this time?!?!

* ""Tell me, how long have you been away from The Great Link"" YESSSSSSSSSSS!

* ""Fearful of loss""...Jean Luc you did NOT just pull that card with Riker.  This doesn't end well.

* Worf interrogating a Changeling, ""I know your kind"" I love it.

* New type of hand phaser model from Worf and it's already set to vaporize.

* Echoes of the Dominion War indeed.  A terrorist breakaway faction of the Changelings after an internal schism?  That honestly tracks.

* ""I was contacted by a close friend within the Link, a man of honor"" awwww Odo called out to Worf!

* Dominion Cold War 2.0 that just went hot

* To Daystrom Station then!  PARTNERS!

* They're all out of options now.  If the Changelings are attacking the Federation and all of this is to keep Picard and company busy with Vadic within the nebula then what in the hell are they currently up to right now?  Is Vadic just one big shiny guard dog?

* Holy fuck, she made them punch themselves in the ass!

* ""Will....Remove yourself from the bridge, you've just killed us all""

* This feels like an Abyss situation, that's not a bad gravity well but a good one....I think.

I mean clearly they're not all going to die as we have more episodes coming up buuuuut...the Changelings want the Federation to suffer and lose and part of that involves getting rid of two old school legends, getting a hold of one of their kids, and distracting them with some flashy attacks using exotic weaponry and a Captain that has a bone to pick with Picard and that kid is now having weird visions of some freaky alien stuff.

That changed with this episode.

Maybe it was Jonathan Frakes direction, maybe it was the return of former Picard season writers Jane Maggs and Cindy Appel… but this is the first episode this season that felt like it put character first.

And it paid off in spades.

Let’s get the bad out of the way first: trying to make the Titan crew a thing, with everything else that’s is going on, is really dragging this season down.

Ensign Laforge having a heart to heart with Seven is a big steaming pile of who cares a lot?

I don’t know Ensign Laforge.  I just met Ensign Laforge. 

Ditching the original Picard crew to make room for the Titan crew is by leaps and bounds the dumbest move they’ve made in the modern Trek era.  That conversation would have gone a lot better if it was with someone we were already familiar with, who was in Starfleet, and who also felt out of place, like… I don’t know… freaking Elnor?!?

Getting onto the good: by leaps and bounds the best thing they’ve done this season, is how they’ve matured and changed the TNG cast.

I loved the new dynamic between Picard and Crusher.  It was a conversation that could have fallen flat on its face, but both of them absolutely sold it.

And I’m loving the combativeness between Picard and Riker.  That’s a dynamic I never thought I’d see.  Riker was always ride or die with Picard, now we have a whole new bag.

And the stuff with Worf and Raffi was great as well.  It’s about time someone acknowledged that Raffi, with all her problems, tends to be right on the money most of the time.  I’m really looking forward to these two as partners in crime.

My only letdown was the Changeling reveal.   It feels like too much fan pandering again.  

I was really hoping for the Conspiracy aliens  if we were doing a callback; they were tied directly to TNG, and were a race we knew virtually nothing about.

To me, DS9 did everything that could be done with Changelings.  They’re a boring, obvious choice.

Once again, special shout out to Amanda Plummer who is absolutely killing it as Vadic.  The way the Shrike utilized that portal weapon was phenomenal.

I hope this is more the direction the show goes going forward.  I know Matalas has further writing credits, so I hope the show doesn’t devolve again into just empty plot and fan pandering.

Let’s give the TNG crew a new kind of story for a sendoff, and not settle for just a WOK knockoff.

I love how Dr. Crusher is treating a patient even though she's not officially Titan's Med staff.

&gt;Beverly: ...As a mother, your whole *being* is about protecting your child. I-I thought I could protect mine. I didn't know... If I could protect yours. 

It's so tough seeing Beverly deal with that type of decision. With the Trauma of Picard's various assassination attempts to boot.



&gt;Jack: Can you please stop looking at me like that? (Like what?) Like I'm the outcome of some science experiment.

&gt;Riker: Sorry to tell you kid, but you are. I spent two decades in a spaceship watching you get cooked up before you were born. 

&gt;Jack: ... Let's just say that in my time on this universe, I've always found one thing to be true: the bigger the legend, the more disappointing the reality. 

I heard he's positronic (!!!)

Calling out Picard's Cyborg life like that :|



Loved riker's scene with Jack!!

&gt;Feel free to call me captain. And yes. I have a wife and daughter. And I had a son. 

Poor Thad :(

Agree with you that Riker publicly throwing Picard under the bus in front of the bridge crew was unprofessional even if the crisis was Picard's fault.

Riker would trade everything for more time with Thad, so he's incredulous at how in denial Picard is about everything with Jack and Beverly. 

I like that Jack's conception was natural. It's soapy but the last time we saw the entire TNG crew together they were fighting a Picard clone so...natural is the best way to go here. 

""This is casual."" - Worf's humor is still on point. Not that Dorn would ever have any trouble inhabiting the role, but Matalas and co. have done an excellent job of bringing him into the tone and visuals of Picard. I also love that he hinted at Odo (I think). 

Janeway and Seven both have Voyager models in their respective quarters. I wonder if they'll ever get to reminisce about their past adventures in their respective shows one day. 

The Riker and Picard split is a good one. Tensions are high, it's natural that both would get frustrated as they're juggling a bajillion issues simultaneously. It's good drama, and ironically something you can only play with 3\~4 main characters who are all captains/would be captains/admirals. 

Amanda Plummer's ""again"" and ""fire"" were delivered so chillingly. Love her acting. Wonder if she's a Changeling too or if their rogue faction also has other non-Changelings. 

I thought they'd maybe wrap up this initial conflict with the Shrike in 3 eps, but I guess we've got more time in the nebula to play WoK.

I like that they are addressing some of the issues from the last two episodes. I'm glad that Picard tried to apologize to Shaw, although Riker should apologize too since he was also responsible for getting this completely unprepared ship into such a dangerous situation.

I do like the Changeling twist. Although, if Odo had already warned Worf about Changeling terrorists, shouldn't he have suspected that the Changelings were involved? Also, why did that Changeling remain in the shape of that criminal? The big threat with the Changelings is that they can be anyone and they can shed identities as easily as we change clothes. Plus, being a Changeling, he should be able to escape quite easily. And it seems like a really bad idea to be killing Changelings considering how seriously the Founders take the death of their kind. 

Also, the bad guys being Changelings may seem to explain why Beverly vaporizes them, but Beverly and Jack didn't know they were being chased by Changelings. Plus Changelings would be a lot better at chasing them down since they can change into the size of a mouse or gas.

With all the callbacks, my guess is that the Changelings are either trying to steal the technology to make the Omega particle or Genesis.

This continues to be the best season of Picard by a mile.

Their Changeling effects were great. I'm a little disappointed that I was apparently wrong about the *Conspiracy* aliens making a return, but the DS9 fanboy in me is totally okay with some of the Great Link refusing Odo's progressive views. The Changeling did say that they were working with enemies of the Federation, so it's possible that we'll see other biggish bads.

I'm really happy with the pacing of this story. In previous seasons of Picard, I feel like the time on the Titan would have been compressed in favor of moving on to the next plot. Instead it feels like the story is moving but it also gets enough time to breathe.

More than previous seasons, I buy Patrick Stewart as an older version of Picard. In the first couple of seasons it just felt like him being Patrick Stewart.

Worf.

The Less Good:

I did not buy for an instant that Will would escalate that sharply against Picard, or that Picard would so sorely lack the self-control necessary to deal with Riker being in command.

That de-aging CGI was amateur hour.

I'm not thrilled about Jack having mystical visions while blacking out from gas. I'm sure it'll have an answer, but... meh?

Worf is honestly the MVP of all this so far. Great stuff in this episode. The Beverly and Picard scenes were good and well acted, and I like the son idea in principle. I just wish the backstory was on all that was a little tighter but that's a minor quibble. The Jack actor is doing a good job, but he still looks old. The accent line was cheesy. The CGI de-aging looked bad but whatever lol. Riker talking about his kids was nice and the standoff at the end was great.

I like the idea of the changelings being the villain and am interested in seeing how it ties into whatever is going on with Vadic and why she wants Jack. Really excited to see how the Dominion War plays into all this.

326,t5_2qixm,False,,False,text,0,startrek,,jallalv,0,False,,True,TheNerdChaplain,True,,1,t2_3mcg0vw6,[],"Overall a very strong episode.  Hell of a scene between Jean-Luc and Beverly, and I daresay it wouldn't have half the weight it did, if we didn't know the truth of Jean-Luc's past from the last two seasons, so absolutely bravo on that.  I also thought they both had really strong arguments for their point of view, so there wasn't really one right answer.  Beverly's line about how the stars had taken her husband Jack, her son Wesley, and Jean-Luc himself was so powerful.  That whole scene was the real highlight of the episode.

I'm glad Shaw is still alive; he didn't get much to do this episode but I want to see more from him, and I was genuinely scared when he flew over that chair. Maybe he'll get a dramatic reentry at the beginning of the next episode to save the day.  I was hoping Riker would reinstate Seven as first officer, but no such luck.  (I get why for story reasons, but it would have made more sense to have someone more familiar with the new Titan at his side instead of an emotionally compromised Jean-Luc.)

It's great seeing Worf back in action.  Michael Dorn's diction sounds a little.... less formal?  Smoother, maybe? than what I remember from DS9 and TNG.  I never thought he'd be the good cop, but that was a fun scene.  I have yet to see how he's a pacifist, which is what I was most curious about from the trailers.  It was great to see him give an update on the Founders and an indirect reference to Odo and the Dominion War.  If they're headed back to the Daystrom Institute, that will explain why we are seeing Lore and Moriarty - effectively two artificial intelligences that are probably being kept there.  I wonder if we won't see a little box with lights on it somewhere that happens to sound like Weyoun or Shran.

While I'm skeptical that ensigns are doing friendly checkups on commanders, I did like the LaForge/Seven scene.  I thought it was a nice touch that she referenced how her dad had trouble making friends, but when he did, he knew their value.  It's such a deep cut to Geordi's perpetual virginity, so to speak, on the Enterprise (though of course he seems to have made up for it).  Speaking of deep cuts, Beverly referenced ""worlds that Starfleet forgot"", which ties in to the Lower Decks theme back in Season 1 (remember Landru?) about Starfleet never following up with worlds they contacted.

I'm glad to see Jack is less of a contrarian now and is contributing a little to the survival of the ship.  The scene with him and Seven was nice, getting her out of her quarters and investigating the leak.

I've said it before and I'll say it again, one of the best things about NuTrek is that they really know how to make starship porn.  Just some really beautiful shots of the Titan in the nebula. Another side note, I really enjoyed the choral music Seven was listening to in her quarters, and the music that Worf was doing Klingon tai chi to.  Props to Stephen Barton, who did the music for this episode.

Finally, the one thing that I didn't like, was the feud between Jean-Luc and Will.  Regardless of who was right, they shouldn't have been having it out on the bridge in front of the crew, and Riker shouldn't have kicked him off the bridge and shouted ""you've killed us all"".  That felt really unprofessional to me, though I get it was maybe a heat of the moment thing.

There are multiple flavors (pun intended) of this show:

1. Cook amazing food with literally ANY ingredient in the quadrant at your fingertips. But you are doing actual cooking. The replicator is only for ingredients.

2. Train the Replicator. Use real ingredients and two cooking techniques, then feed the food to the replicator and see what comes out during replication. Did it get it right? How do you have to alter your dish so that when it is replicated it tastes correct? This can contain discussions about what is and is not able to be replicated or what things are difficult to capture the essence of.

But they have no end of warriors, and once you die there... you become one of them.

I'd love a sort of anthology series that takes place in various timespans.  You could start with the now Bajoran inspired warrior-monks and their spiritual leader Opaka witnessing the aftermath of the dominion war and the complications this causes both quadrants.  The next episode could be 200 years later, with the same characters, no need for aging makeup.  Perhaps the Bajorans rediscover her as a spiritual leader and make and maintain contact with her for long periods, bringing news, supplies, and intrigue!

Ever wonder what the Trek universe will look like in the year 20,000?  How about 100,000 years after the fall of the federation?
